<strong>Group</strong> Club; <strong>Traits</strong> Shove, Two-Hand 2d10, Uncommon, Versatile P</div><div><br /></div><div>This staff is topped by a pointed metal circle from which hang several smaller rings that jingle and clang noisily as the staff is moved, allowing you to announce your presence and scare off wild animals as you walk.</div><h2>Traits</h2><div><strong>Shove:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Two-Hand 1d10:</strong></div><div>This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Versatile P:</strong></div><div>A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.</div></div>
