[Detection, Divination]</strong><br />
You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a trained-tier detect magic spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/seek" target="_blank">Seek</a>, you gain the benefits of an expert tier detect magic spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking).
