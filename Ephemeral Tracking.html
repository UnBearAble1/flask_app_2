<strong>Ephemeral Tracking; Divination<br />
2 Actions somatic, verbal ; Duration 1 hour</strong><br />
You can look at currents in the air and water and see tracks that you can follow just as you would on land. You can use Survival to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/track" target="_blank">Track</a> through both air and water, noticing aerial or aquatic “tracks” of all creatures who passed nearby in the last hour. It's more difficult to Track in this way: the DC to Track through air or water is always 1 tier higher, or higher after precipitation or wind (in the air) or heavy tides or currents (in the water). It's possible to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/cover-tracks" target="_blank">Cover Tracks</a> against this spell, but creatures might not realize they need to do so.</div></div>
