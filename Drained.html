<div data-component-type="text"><div>When a creature successfully drains you of blood or life force, you become less healthy. Drained always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to your drained value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude saves. You also lose a number of hit points equal to your Drained value multiplied by 5.  Losing these Hit Points doesn’t count as taking damage.</div><div><br /></div><div>Each time you get a full night’s rest, your drained value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don’t immediately recover the lost Hit Points.</div></div>
