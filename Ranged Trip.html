<div data-component-type="text"><div>This weapon can be used to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/trip" target="_blank">Trip</a> with the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn't deal any damage when used to Trip. This trait usually appears only on a thrown weapon.</div></div>
