As the soul won't be returning to the original body, only a small portion of the creature's remains are required. <em>These remains must have been part of the original body at the time of death</em>, and the target must have died within the past year. If Pharasma has decided that the target's time has come or the target's soul is trapped or doesn't wish to return, this ritual automatically fails, but you discover this after you succeed at the Primary check and can end the ritual without paying the cost.</div><div><br /></div><div>If the ritual is successful, the target's new body has a random ancestry. The ancestry feats of the character are replaced entirely, rolled fully randomly, and those results are used by the player and DM to determine what ancestry the character is. </div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li>Critical Success You reincarnate the target into a new adult body. This new body has full HP and has the same spells prepared and points in their pools as the original did when it died.</li>  <li>Success: As critical success, except the new body has 1 HP and no spells prepared or points in any pools. The soul takes some time to adjust to their new body, leaving them <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/drained" target="_blank">drained</a> 2 for 1 week. This condition can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. </li>  <li>Failure: You fail to reincarnate the target. The primary caster suffers a magical miscast. Further checks to reincarnate the target are at -2 (cumulative.) You don't expend the herbs. </li>  <li>Critical Failure: As failure, except each caster suffers a magical miscast. Further, the target creature, should it ever be successfully reincarnated, also re-enters the world with the effects of a magical miscast - the result of which can only impact the target creature itself (re-roll until this is possible, and/or the DM may twist the results of an inapplicable miscast to make it apply.) You don't expend the herbs.</li></ul></div>
