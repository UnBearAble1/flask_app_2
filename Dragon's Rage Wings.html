You sprout dragon wings from your back of the same color as your chosen dragon. While you are raging, each round you gain a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/movement" target="_blank">fly speed</a> equal to your speed but it ends at the end of the round and you begin to fall - gliding down 60 feet (you take no damage if you hit the ground.)<br />
<br />
If you are flying when your rage ends, you start to fall but the transformation only completes at the last moment, so you take no damage from the fall and land standing up.</div></div>
