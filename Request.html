You must couch the request in terms that <em>the target would accept</em> given their current attitude toward you. The GM sets the <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/diplomacy" target="_blank">Diplomacy</a> DC based on the difficulty of the request. Some requests are unsavory or impossible, and even a helpful NPC would never agree to them.</div><ul>
  <li><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target agrees to your request without qualifications.</li>  <li><strong>Success</strong> The target agrees to your request, but they might demand added provisions or alterations to the request.</li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> The target refuses the request, though they might propose an alternative that is less extreme.</li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Not only does the target refuse the request, but their attitude toward you decreases by one step due to the temerity of the request.</li></ul></div>
