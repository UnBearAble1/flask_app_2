Padded armor is easier to damage and destroy than other types of armor. Heavy armor comes with a padded armor undercoat included in its Price, though it loses the comfort trait when worn under heavy armor. You can wear just that padded armor undercoat to sleep in, if your heavy armor is destroyed, or when otherwise not wearing the full heavy armor. This allows you to keep any magical benefits associated magical heavy armor, but no one else can wear your heavy armor without the padded undercoat.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Comfort</strong>: The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.</div></div>
