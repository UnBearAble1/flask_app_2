You summon a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/shadow" target="_blank">shadow</a> in a space adjacent to the dying creature. The shadow has its usual stats, with the following modifications:</div><ul>
  <li>The greater shadow's shadow hand Strike deals an additional 1d8 poison damage.</li>  <li>When you Cast a Spell, you can use the shadow's location as the origin point instead of your own location. Upon doing so, the shadow immediately disappears.</li>  <li>If the dying creature targeted by this spell dies or regains consciousness, the shadow disappears and this spell ends.</li></ul></div>
