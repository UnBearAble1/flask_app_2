You pour invigorating positive energy into a living ally. If the next action you use is to cast heal to restore Hit Points to a single living creature, the target deals an additional 1d6 positive damage with its melee weapons and unarmed attacks until the end of its next turn. If the heal spell is at least master level, this damage increases to 2d6, or 3d6 if the spell is legendary. </div></div>
