When you twist the sphere, it creates an opaque mist in a burst centered on one corner of your space. Creatures within that area are concealed, and all other creatures are <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a> to them. Any creature with a weakness to the precious metal that starts its turn in the mist takes damage equal to its weakness. The mist lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. Most metalmist spheres are filled with silver or cold iron, but more expensive versions containing other ingredients might exist.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>TRAINED</strong></div><div><strong>Price</strong> 8 gp</div><div>The radius of the burst is 5 feet.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>EXPERT </strong></div><div><strong>Price</strong> 32 gp</div><div>The radius of the burst is 10 feet.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>MASTER</strong></div><div><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp</div><div>The radius of the burst is 15 feet.</div></div>
