Make a spell attack roll against your target's AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach. On a success, you deal 5d4 fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and 5d4 persistent fire damage.</div></div>
