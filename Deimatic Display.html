Imitating animal threat displays, you make yourself appear larger and more imposing. Roll one Intimidation check to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/demoralize" target="_blank">Demoralize</a> and compare the result to the Will DC of each animal, fungus, and plant creature in a 15-foot cone. When you do, Demoralize gains the visual trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. You don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.</div></div>
