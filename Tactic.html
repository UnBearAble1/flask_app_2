<div data-component-type="text"><div>A tactic, similar to a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stance" target="_blank">stance</a>, requires a certain amount of positioning, strategic thought, planning, and mental energy. Because of which, you cannot use more than one type of tactic in a single round. You can use a stance and a tactic, and you can use the same tactic multiple times, but you are unable to gain the benefits of multiple tactics within the same round. </div><div><br /></div><div>Feats that list a Tactic feat as a prerequisite are generally considered Tactic feats as well, though they may be used interchangeably and in combination with the original tactic feat. For example, &quot;Hunt Prey&quot; is a tactic feat, and &quot;Outwit&quot; lists Hunt Prey as a prerequisite. Outwit doesn't say &quot;Tactic,&quot; but it is assumed to have this keyword because of the requirement. Even though that makes both tactic feats, you can still use them in the same round as one another, but you couldn't use a non-Hunt Prey related feat in combination with them. </div></div>
