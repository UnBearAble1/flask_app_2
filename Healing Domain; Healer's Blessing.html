Your healing magic is particularly potent. You gain the following Focus Spell, and increase your Focus Point Pool by 1.<br />
<br />
<strong>Healer's Blessing; Necromancy<br />
1 Action ; verbal<br />
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing living creature; Duration 1 minute</strong><br />
Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 8 additional Hit Points.<br />
<br />
The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.</div></div>
