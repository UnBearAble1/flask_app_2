<strong>Group</strong> Flail; <strong>Traits</strong> Agile, Disarm, Finesse, Nonlethal, Sweep</div><div><br /></div><div>A scourge—also known as a cat-o’-nine-tails—is a set of several knotted cords made from cotton or leather and attached to a handle. While most scourges are more suitable for torture than combat, the weapons used by the Order of the Scourge have metal barbs woven in to pierce clothing and armor. The scourge is a martial melee weapon.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Disarm:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Nonlethal:</strong></div><div>An effect with this trait is not inherently deadly. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Sweep:</strong></div><div>This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.</div></div>
