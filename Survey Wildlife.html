Attempt a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/survival-wis" target="_blank">Survival</a> check against a DC determined by the GM based on how obvious the signs are. On a success, you can attempt a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a> check with a –2 penalty to learn more about the creatures just from these signs.
