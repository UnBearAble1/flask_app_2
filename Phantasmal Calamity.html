The vision deals 10d6 mental damage (basic Will save). On a critical failure, the creature must also succeed at a Reflex save or believe it's trapped (stuck in a fissure, adrift at sea, or some other fate in keeping with its vision). If it fails the second save, it's also <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stunned" target="_blank">stunned </a>for 1 minute. It can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it disbelieves the illusion and recovers from the stunned condition.</div><div><br /></div><div>Heightened: The damage increases by 4d6.</div></div>
