When you cast doubt upon your foes, the effect lasts longer than usual. After being <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/enfeebled" target="_blank">enfeebled</a> 2 by your Glimpse of Redemption, the foe is enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. If you have <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/weight-of-guilt" target="_blank">Weight of Guilt</a>, after being <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stupefied" target="_blank">stupefied</a> 2 by your Glimpse of Redemption, the foe is stupefied 1 for 1 minute or until the flat check from stupefied causes it to lose a spell, whichever comes first.</div></div>
