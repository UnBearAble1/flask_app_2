Choose a target within your reach, or within the reach of a melee weapon you're wielding. If you can use Spellstrike with a ranged weapon (with the Eldritch Archer feat, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon. For an instant, you transform your weapon or unarmed attack into a spike of pure force, replacing all its normal statistics and abilities. The force fang automatically deals 3d4+3 force damage to the target.</div></div>
