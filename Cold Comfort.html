When emptied into an adjacent body of water, the pellets freeze the water's surface almost instantly, creating an ice block in a 10-foot square to a depth of 1 foot. Any creatures inside this space must attempt a DC 19 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 cold damage and is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/immobilized" target="_blank">immobilized</a> for 1 minute or until it Escapes (DC 19) or the ice is broken. The entire ice block has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, cold damage, and precision damage. The ice is strong enough to support one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/balance" target="_blank">Balance</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>EXPERT </strong></div><div><strong>Cost</strong>: 10 gp</div><div>Ice created by the pellets lasts for 1 hour or until broken.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LEGENDARY</strong></div><div><strong>Cost</strong>: 50 gp</div><div>The area increases to a 20-foot square, the save DC increases to 23, the cold damage increases to 4d6 and the Escape DC increases to 23.
