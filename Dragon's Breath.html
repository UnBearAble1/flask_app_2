You can put more effort into your Breath Weapon to channel greater draconic power, though it takes more out of you. When you use Breath Weapon, you can increase the damage dice to d8s and increase the area to 60 feet for a line breath weapon or 30 feet for a cone. If you do, you can't use your Breath Weapon again until your next daily preparations</div></div>
