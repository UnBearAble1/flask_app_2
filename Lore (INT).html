<div data-component-type="text"><div>You have specialized information on a narrow topic. Lore features many subcategories. You might have Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar subcategory of the skill. Each subcategory counts as its own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore wouldn’t increase your proficiency with Sailing Lore, for example.</div><div><br /></div><div>You gain a specific subcategory of the Lore skill at the expert proficiency tier at character creation, and can improve it (or select others) with investment in the Professional Class Proficiency. The GM determines what other subcategories they’ll allow as Lore skills, though these categories are always less broad than any of the other skills that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they should never be able to fully or mainly take the place of another skill’s Recall Knowledge action. For instance, Magic Lore wouldn’t enable you to recall the same breadth of knowledge covered by Arcana, Adventuring Lore wouldn’t simply give you all the information an adventurer needs, and Planar Lore would not be sufficient to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you have multiple subcategories of Lore that could apply to a check or that would overlap with another skill in the circumstances, you can use the skill with the better skill modifier or the one you would prefer to use. If there’s any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic or action, the GM decides whether it can be used or not. Even if you’re untrained in Lore, you can use it to Recall Knowledge.</div><div><br /></div><div>The more specific the lore, the lower the DC of Recall Knowledge compared to other more broad skills: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Broad Skill </strong>(such as society or nature): Base DC as per Recall Knowledge </li>  <li><strong>Broad Lore Skill </strong>(such as art lore or forest lore): -2 to DC </li>  <li><strong>Narrow Lore Skill </strong>(such as sculpture lore or forest predator lore) -4 to DC</li>  <li><strong>Extremely Narrow Lore Skill</strong> (such as 4th century sculpture lore, or brown bear lore) -6 to DC</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Trained Lore Actions</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><ul>
