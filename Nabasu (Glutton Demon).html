<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat 6 </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material Plane from the Abyss, an invasive infestation that releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life. Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more powerful. Once they have sufficiently feasted, the demons become worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo a vile transformation, finally digesting their accumulated meals and deforming further into powerful vrolikais.</div><div><br /></div><div>Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those who prefer the tang of undead flesh.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fiend (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CE, Medium, Demon, Fiend, Lurker</strong> </div><div>Perception +10; darkvision</div><div>Languages Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic; telepathy 100 feet</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +10, Arcana +8, Religion +8, Stealth +10, Survival +9</div><div>Str +6, Dex +4, Con +6, Int +2, Wis +3, Cha +4</div><div><strong>AC 19; Fort +7 , Ref +11 , Will +9; +1 to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 60; Weaknesses cold iron 5, good 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet, fly 50 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>: </div><ul>

      <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected and the nabasu suffers starvation vulnerability.</li>      <li>Success The creature is unaffected.</li>      <li>Failure The creature is affected by death-stealing gaze and becomes drained 1. If the creature was already drained 1 by the death-stealing gaze before attempting the save, a failed save increases the value of the drained condition by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. The nabasu gains 10 temporary Hit Points, and the drained creature is temporarily immune until the start of the nabasu's next turn.</li>      <li>Critical Failure As failure, but the creature increases the amount of drain by 2.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Stolen Death: A creature that dies while suffering drain from a nabasu's death-stealing gaze rises as a ghoul the next midnight.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
