You push back as you block the attack, knocking your foe away or off balance. You use your shield to push the triggering creature, either automatically <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/shove" target="_blank">Shoving</a> it 5 feet or causing it to become <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> until the start of your next turn. The triggering creature chooses whether to be moved or become flat-footed. If it chooses to be moved, you choose the direction.
