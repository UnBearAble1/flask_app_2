<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>5 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Performance; Composition Spell</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: </strong><a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/composition-spells" target="_blank"><strong>Composition Spells</strong></a><br />
You learn the Inspire Competence composition cantrip, which aids your allies’ skills.<br />
<br />
<strong>Inspire Competence; Cantrip, Composition, Emotion, Enchantment, Mental<br />
1 Action; verbal; Range 60 feet; Targets 1 ally; Duration 1 round</strong><br />
Your encouragement inspires your ally to succeed at a task. This counts as having taken sufficient preparatory actions to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/aid" target="_blank">Aid</a> your ally on a skill check of your choice, regardless of the circumstances. When you later use the Aid reaction, you can roll Performance instead of the normal skill check, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead. If you are legendary in Performance, you automatically critically succeed.<br />
<br />
The GM might rule that you can't use this ability if the act of encouraging your ally would interfere with the skill check (such as a check to Sneak quietly or maintain a disguise).</div></div>
