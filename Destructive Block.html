When you <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/shield-block" target="_blank">Shield Block</a>, you can reduce the damage to yourself by double the shield's Hardness, but if you do, the shield takes double the normal amount of damage it would have taken (before applying its Hardness).
