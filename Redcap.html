<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6 </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Redcaps are sadistic and capricious fey who thrill in bloodletting and murder. While they are most famous for appearing as wizened, bearded men, redcap women are no less fearsome or cruel. Redcaps are ultimately craven bullies, cowed by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear and despise the symbols of good deities. Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps draw power from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just as iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of their metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcerting— especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and long, white, tangled hair.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CE, Small, Fey, Skirmisher </strong></div><div>Perception +10; low-light vision</div><div>Languages Common, Sylvan</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +8, Athletics +10, Deception +6, Intimidation +8, Nature +5, Stealth +10</div><div>Str +4, Dex +4, Con +2, Int +1, Wis +1, Cha +2</div><div><strong>AC 20 ; Fort +9 , Ref +11 , Will +7</strong></div><div><strong>HP 60 (fast healing 10); Weaknesses cold iron 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 50 feet</strong></div><div><br />
<strong>Features</strong>: </div><ul>
  <li>Red Cap (necromancy, primal) A redcap’s woolen hat is dyed with the blood of its victims. If the redcap loses its cap, it no longer benefits from fast healing and takes a –4 status penalty to its damage rolls. It can create a new cap in 10 minutes, but that cap doesn’t grant its powers until the redcap has turned it red with Blood Soak. A cap has no benefit for creatures other than the redcap who made it. Snatching their cap uses the same rules as <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/disarm" target="_blank">Disarm</a>. </li>  <li>Divine Revulsion (emotion, fear, mental) If a redcap sees a creature brandish a religious symbol of a good deity (which requires an interact action by that creature) or use one to cast a divine spell, the redcap must attempt a DC 14 Will save. It then becomes temporarily immune to all brandished religious symbols for 10 minutes.

      <li>Trigger The redcap reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points with a scythe Strike. </li>      <li>Effect The redcap makes another scythe Strike against a different creature, using the same multiple attack penalty as the scythe Strike that triggered this reaction. This counts toward its multiple attack penalty.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>: </div><ul>
