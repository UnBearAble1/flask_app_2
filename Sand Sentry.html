The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area of great importance—these elementals are patient participants in such roles, making them well suited for long-term service.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Elemental (Arcana, Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Medium, Earth, Elemental, Skirmisher </strong></div><div>Perception +10; darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet</div><div>Languages Terran</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +8, Stealth +8 (+10 in sand)</div><div>Str +5, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +0, Wis +2, Cha +1</div><div><strong>AC 20 ; Fort +9 , Ref +11 , Will +7</strong></div><div><strong>HP 60; Immunities bleed, paralyzed, poison, sleep</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet, burrow 50 feet; earth glide</strong></div><div><br />

  <li>Earth Glide: A sand sentry can Burrow through earthen matter, including rock. When it does so, it moves at its full burrow Speed, leaving no tunnels or signs of its passing.</li>  <li>Glass Armor: When the sand sentry takes fire or lightning damage, its outer layer of sand fuses into sheets of hardened glass for 1 minute. This increases the sand sentry's AC to 22 and grants it resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, piercing, and slashing damage. A sand sentry can't use earth glide while glass armor is active.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>: </div><ul>
