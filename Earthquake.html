  <li><strong>Shaking Ground</strong> The ground is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/difficult-terrain" target="_blank">difficult terrain</a>, and creatures on it take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks.</li>  <li><strong>Fissures</strong> Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require DC 15 Athletics to Climb.</li>  <li><strong>Collapse</strong> Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it.

      <li>Critical Success The creature takes half the collapse damage.</li>      <li>Success The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls prone.</li>      <li>Failure The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls prone.</li>      <li>Critical Failure The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul></div>
