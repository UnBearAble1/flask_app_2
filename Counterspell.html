Reaction; Abjuration; Trigger A creature Casts a Spell that you have in your repertoire<br />
</strong></div><div>When a foe Casts a Spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own magic to disrupt it. You must know the spell, then successfully roll to cast it, suffering all the same rules as casting it. This roll also counts as your counteract roll.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+2 Points) Consume Spell </strong>(Requires: Expert in Spellcaster): When you successfully Counterspell a spell of the tradition that matches your tradition, you consume it, replenishing yourself with its energy. When you do, you are nourished as if you had eaten a meal and regain Hit Points equal to twice the tier of the counteracted spell. This healing effect is equal to the tier of the spell countered. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+2 Points) Clever Counterspell: </strong>(Requires: <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/quick-recognition" target="_blank">Quick Recognition</a>; Master in Spellcaster) Instead of being able to counter a foe’s spell with Counterspell only if you have that same spell in your repertoire, you can use Counterspell as long as you have the spell in your tradition. When you use Counterspell in this way, you must know a spell that shares a trait other than its tradition with the triggering spell. At the GM’s discretion, you can instead use a spell that has an opposing trait or that otherwise logically would counter the triggering spell (such as using a cold or water spell to counter fireball or using remove fear to counter a fear spell). Regardless of what spell you expend, you take a –2 penalty to your counteract check, though the GM can waive this penalty if the expended spell is especially appropriate.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+5 Points) Reflect Spell:</strong> Requires (Requires: Master in Spellcaster): When you successfully use Counterspell to counteract a spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell affects only the original caster, even if it’s an area spell or it would normally affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
