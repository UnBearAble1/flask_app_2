You have a system that lets you search at great speed, finding details and secrets twice as quickly as others can. When Searching, you take half as long as usual to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/search1" target="_blank">Search</a> a given area. This means that while exploring, you double the Speed you can move while ensuring you’ve Searched an area before walking into it (up to half your Speed).
