Your instincts sing of spite and malice, and you've learned a devastating trick: go for the eyes. You make a claw Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/dazzled" target="_blank">dazzled </a>for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/blinded" target="_blank">blinded </a>for 1 round and dazzled until restored to maximum hit points. Either way, once you use this attack on an enemy, they become immune for 24 hours as they grow wary of your tricks.</div></div>
