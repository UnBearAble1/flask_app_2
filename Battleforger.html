You can sharpen weapons, polish armor, and apply special techniques to temporarily gain better effects from your armaments. By spending 1 hour working on a weapon or armor, you can grant it a +2 item bonus to damage rolls for a weapon, giving a shield +4 hardness, or giving armor a DR (or bonus to DR) or 2 against bludgeoning, piercing and slashing attacks. This effect lasts until your next daily preparations. </div></div>
