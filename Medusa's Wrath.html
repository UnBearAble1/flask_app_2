<strong>Medusa's Wrath <br />
2 Actions; Transmutation, somatic, verbal</strong></div><div><strong>(Special: This Focus power costs 2 focus points to cast)</strong><br />
You make an attack filled with a medusa's petrifying power. Make an unarmed Strike with the following additional effects.</div><ul>
  <li>Critical Success The target is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/slowed" target="_blank">slowed</a> 2 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from medusa's wrath, it is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/petrified" target="_blank">petrified</a> permanently. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.</li>  <li>Success As critical success, but the target is initially slowed 1.</li></ul></div>
