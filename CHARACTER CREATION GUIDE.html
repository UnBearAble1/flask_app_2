<div data-component-type="text"><div>Before making your character, it is good to understand what this game is and is not, especially since the game is largely based on popular fantasy games where a few of these things may not be true: </div><div><br /></div><ol>
  <li>This game is about badass heroes on a journey of exploration, impacting the world around them, not about the ever-increasing power creep of a group of weakish heroes as they rise to god-like ability. It assumes your characters are already very capable, maybe even legendary in their field, and your character's growth will be<em> horizontal not vertical.</em> You are playing the equivalents Aragorn from Lord of the Rings, Lan and Moraine from Wheel of Time, Elric of Melniboné from the from the Eternal Champion books, or Roland of Gilead from the Dark Tower series. </li>  <li>The game's &quot;grit&quot; is designed to feel like a book, TV series, or movie. Anywhere we could, we tried take out elements of this game's roots that made it feel too much like you were controlling an &quot;toon&quot;. Combat is supposed to be fast and violent, and often leave characters with serious wounds to tend to. </li>  <li>Magic items aren't a part of assumed character power. The magic items of this game are assumed to be plentiful but consumable (thank you Numenera for that great idea), with the few more &quot;permanent&quot; your party finds all requiring some type of fuel (such as a sword that must collect screams to unleash it's magic, or a pair of boots that require powering up by trodding miles of untread territory to recharge their ability.) </li>  <li>Your characters adventure not just for physical treasure, but for internal growth as well. Learning new abilities, spells, formulas and the like means a lot of homework for your character. Engaging a teacher or learning from books could take months - the shortcuts are the inspirations and epiphanies they have when discovering new places, battling new monsters, or engaging with other dangerous parts of the world. </li>  <li>Almost everything in the entire game falls into one of the five tiers:  <strong>Untrained, Trained, Expert, Master, </strong>or<strong> Legendary.</strong> Unless otherwise stated, being untrained in a thing means you are -4 to your roll, trained means you are +3, and each rank above trained gives a cumulative +3 to a roll. </li></ol><div><br /></div><div>To begin making your character, follow the steps below. Each section will likely take you down a rabbit hole of thousands of feats and abilities. If you want inspiration, check out our library of sample starter  characters. We also strongly suggest you make a copy <a data-composite="true" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EVW_sOhfDP88dxTi-1R6qI-DQs2oT65U08cs04wN4pk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">character build tracker</a>, and make a copy of <a data-composite="true" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yxZ-rsdnNPzfysYBe7oyrW_y-Rssjxp0nGY1UtHaluU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the character sheet</a>. </div><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">STEP ONE: DESIGN YOUR CLASS </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>You have 7 Class Points to divide among the four building blocks of every character: <strong>Alchemist</strong>, <strong>Professional</strong>, <strong>Spellcaster</strong>, and <strong>Warrior</strong>. The way you spend these points will ultimately tell the story of every other aspect of your character, and you will <em>never earn more class points</em>. With these points you are effectively describing the core concept for your character.  One of the benefits of spending points into a Class Skill is a gradual increase in the Tier of the skill itself. There are three things gained by having higher tiers in Class Skills: </div><ul>
  <li>Each tier gives you +2 to the roll when doing the thing the Class Skill covers.</li>  <li>Each tier unlocks access to that tier's special Class feats (for example, the powerful <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/miracle-worker" target="_blank">Miracle Worker</a> Alchemist feat requires a Legendary tier in the <em>Alchemist</em> Class Skill.) </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Use the following four Drop Downs to look build your Class. </strong></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">ALCHEMIST SKILL </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><strong>ALCHEMIST: </strong>By taking levels in the Class Proficiency: Alchemist, your character unlocks the art of <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/alchemist" target="_blank">Alchemy Infusion</a>. Alchemists tie a part of their own personal magic into their alchemical items, and are able to both create some items during their daily preparations and quickly and instantly whip up alchemy on the fly. Other notes: </div><ul>
  <li>Use your Alchemist Tier bonus for attack rolls with Alchemical Items and any Save DCs for those items</li>  <li>Because Alchemical items require a great deal of individual personalization (due to the personal magical component) from each individual Alchemist, learning new formulas beyond what you get from your Alchemist Class Skill is much more difficult than just writing them down. As with most things, the easiest way is through adventuring <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/learning-and-epiphanies" target="_blank">epiphanies and inspiration.</a></li>  <li>You gain added benefits for limiting your access to certain types of Alchemical items when crafting and using Alchemy Infusion.
    <ul>
      <li>If your character loses access to one of the following Alchemical Item types: Elixirs, Bombs, or Mutagens, you begin play with three extra formulas.</li>      <li>If your character ONLY has access to one type of Alchemical Item, you can pick one of two options: 
        <ul>
          <li>Your actual proficiency tier in the Alchemist Class Skill is treated as one higher. For example, if you spend 4 points into Alchemist, but can only use Elixirs, instead of getting the Alchemist Class Skill at Master, you'd get it at Legendary.</li>          <li>-or- You know six extra formulas</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>As part of this step in character creation, you'll also want to select which <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/alchemical-items" target="_blank">Alchemical Items</a> your character has the formulas for. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Alchemist Benefits by Spend:</strong> (Each point benefit package is NOT cumulative.

When you take this skill, you must immediately decide what kind of spellcaster you are - which limits your spell selection: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Arcane:</strong> Arcane spellcasters use logic and rationality to categorize the magic inherent in the world around them. Because of its far-reaching approach, the arcane tradition has the broadest spell list, though it’s generally poor at affecting the spirit or the soul. Wizards are the most iconic arcane spellcasters, poring over tomes and grimoires, though arcane sorcerers study the secrets of their blood to unlock the power within themselves.</li>  <li><strong>Divine:</strong> The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Material Plane. Clerics are the most iconic divine spellcasters, beseeching the gods to grant them their magic. Divine sorcerers can use the blood of their celestial or fiendish ancestors as a divine conduit, and champions call upon their gods to grant them martial prowess through divine guidance.</li>  <li><strong>Occult:</strong> The practitioners of occult traditions seek to understand the unexplainable, categorize the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in a systematic way. Bards are the most iconic occult spellcasters, collecting strange esoterica and using their performances to influence the mind or elevate the soul, and occult sorcerers strive to understand the mysterious power in their blood.</li>  <li><strong>Primal:</strong> An instinctual connection to and faith in the world, the cycle of day and night, the turning of the seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey drive the primal tradition. Druids are the most iconic primal spellcasters, calling upon the magic of nature through deep faith and a connection to the plants and animals around them, and primal sorcerers call upon their fey or beast blood to harness the same natural energies.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Spellcasting in this game favors a risk-reward system, instead of a <a data-composite="true" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vancian_magic#:~:text=Vancian%20magic%20(uncountable),a%20finite%20number%20of%20times." target="_blank">Vancian system</a> common in other similar fantasy games. You can start play with a Legendary spellcaster, capable of harnessing powerful Legendary Spells, able to destroy masses, summon dragons, or travel dimensions... but bear in mind that the more powerful the spell you attempt to cast, the more severe the consequences of failure. A critical failure on a spellcasting roll to cast a Legendary-Tier spell could end up costing your character their life. </div><div><br /></div><div>A few other notes on Spellcasting: </div><ul>
  <li>Use your Spellcasting Tier bonus for attack rolls and any Save DCs with your spells</li>  <li>Because spells are deeply personal to each spellcaster, regardless of their tradition, adding new spells to your repertoire isn't as easy as copying them into your spellbook. Each spell is an ingrained, personal bit of knowledge that could take a long time to learn.  As with most things, the easiest way is through adventuring <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/learning-and-epiphanies" target="_blank">epiphanies and inspiration</a>.</li>  <li>Because Occult and Divine spellcasters have a less robust selection of reality altering magics, they begin play knowing 1 extra cantrip and 3 extra spells.</li>  <li>If your character is only able to cast a single school of magic (evocation, divination, conjuration, etc) your actual proficiency tier in the Spellcaster Class Skill is treated as one higher. For example, if you spend 4 points into Spellcaster, but can only cast Divination spells, instead of getting the Spellcaster Class Skill at Expert, you'd get it at Master. </li>  <li>As part of this step in character creation, you will also want to write down what spells your character has in their repertoire. Pick from the appropriate list: <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/arcane-spells" target="_blank">Arcane</a>, <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/divine-spells" target="_blank">Divine</a>, <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/occult-spells" target="_blank">Occult</a>, or <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/primal-spells" target="_blank">Primal</a>. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Spellcaster Benefits by Spend:</strong> (Each point benefit package is NOT cumulative.

You have four of them: Light, Moderate, Serious, and Grievous. To get these numbers, divide your total hit points by 10, and round down. Your Light Injury Threshold is double that number. Your Moderate is three times that number, your Serious is four, and your Grievous five.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Example: If you have 65 hit points, you'd start by dividing that number by 10, round down. So you get (65 / 10) = 6. Then you'd multiple that by 2, 3, 4 and 5 to get these Injury Thresholds:  Light: 12, Moderate: 18, Serious 24, Grievous 30. </div><div><br /></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/wounds-and-healing" target="_blank">Learn how hit points and Injury Thresholds work</a>. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Other Secondary Statistics</strong>: Each of the following secondary statistics begins at the &quot;trained&quot; proficiency tier (remember, the tiers are Untrained, Trained, Expert, Master, Legendary).

YOUR ANCESTRY </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>Work with your GM to decide what kinds of ancestries are appropriate for your game setting (they may even have custom lists of what Complications and Feats are available to each type), but this game assumes anything is possible... after all, your character may have Ancestry benefits that were only afforded to an obscure sub-sect of your overall Ancestry.  </div><div><br /></div><div>There are two components to your Ancestry:  Feats and Complications. </div><div><br /></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/all-ancestry-feats" target="_blank"><strong>Ancestry Feats</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Ancestry feats are the 'abilities' your character gained from being a member of their ancestry. These may not be all of the possible benefits provided by that ancestry, but they are the ones your character managed to hold on to as they started their career in life. You have 20 points to spend on Ancestry Feats. The only way to get any more points is by selecting Ancestry Complications (below). After character creation, you will be unable to select any further Ancestry Feats. (Note: Some Ancestry feats have prerequisites - typically other ancestry feats.) </div><div><br /></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/complications" target="_blank"><strong>Ancestry Complications</strong></a><strong>:</strong> These are obstacles your character must live with as a result of being a member of their ancestry. They are completely optional, and you don't need to select any, but if you do, you may only select up to 5 points in complications. These points are then added to your overall starting Ancestry Feat point pool (for example, if your Ancestry was notorious for setting fires, and you selected the &quot;Pyromaniac&quot; 1 point complication, you'd start play with 21 points in Ancestry feats instead of 20.) </div><div><br /></div><div>At the end of the day, your Ancestry Feats and Ancestry Complications must make sense for the story. Optimization is fun, but cartoonish characters may not be. Your GM has final arbitration on what is appropriate for an ancestry in their game world. </div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">STEP FIVE: SELECT CLASS FEATS AND COMPLICATIONS</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>The bulk of your character's abilities will come from Class Feats. In fact, in addition to the story opening up options to learn more spells or alchemical formulas, the primary game reward, Experience Points, are used solely to buy new Class Feats. </div><div><br /></div><div>As with Ancestry, the two components of this section are: </div><div><br /></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/complications" target="_blank"><strong>Background Complications</strong></a>:  Before you select your Class feats, you may want to better assess how many total points you'll have available by selecting complications. While Ancestry Complications represent common complications in your character's Ancestry, background complications (even though they use the same list) represent ones unique to your character's own experiences or situations. They are completely optional, and you don't need to select any, but if you do, you may only select up to 10 points in background complications. These points are then added to your overall starting Class Feat point pool. Again, work with your GM when selecting complications, as some may be much more disruptive to their planned game than others. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Class Feats</strong>: You begin play with 25 points in Class Feats, plus however many points you optionally added (up to 10) from Background complications. Your character can only know a class feat if they meet the prerequisite for it, which is typically either another Class feat or a specific rank in a Class Skill, Secondary Stat, or Skill. </div><div><br /></div><div>You can also spend these 25-35 points at this stage of character creation on skills raises. Each raise costs 2 of these points. </div><div><br /></div><div>At this point in your character creation, you should have a solid idea of what tiers all of your abilities are at. We encourage you to select Class feats based on what your character is especially good at doing. Because there are thousands of class feats, we've broken them up based on the Class Skill, Secondary Stat, or regular Skill they are connected to below. </div><div><br /></div><div>(Note: Many of these feats provide <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/focus-spells" target="_blank">focus spells</a>, which are special limited-resource magic.) </div><div><br /></div><ul>
