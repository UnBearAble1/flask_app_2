The sheer force of your faith can bring a foe crashing down. If the next action you use is to cast harm or heal to damage one creature, the target is knocked <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/prone" target="_blank">prone</a> if it takes any damage from the spell. If the target critically fails its save against the spell, it also takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 minute.</div></div>
