<strong>Group</strong> Sling; <strong>Traits</strong> Agile, Propulsive, Uncommon</div><div><br /></div><div>Tengu use these specialized slings to fire darts further and with greater force than when thrown by hand, which is particularly effective when attacking from great heights. A thunder sling uses darts as ammunition. It can also hurl blowgun darts as ammunition but deals 2d4 piercing damage instead of 2d6 when used this way.<br />
</div><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Propulsive:</strong></div><div>You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div></div>
