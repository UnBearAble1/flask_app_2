Reaction;  Trigger: A foe within reach attempts to move away from you.</strong><br />
You keep pace with a retreating foe. <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stride" target="_blank">Stride</a> up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you’ve moved your full Speed. You can use No Escape to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type. If you are a master in Warrior, this movement does not provoke reaction attacks from the target. </div></div>
