<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Quick Alchemy</strong></div><div><strong>1 action, manipulate</strong></div><div>Roll an Alchemist check with a DC based on which tier of item you are attempting to create (assuming you have the appropriate level to create it):   Trained: 20,  Expert: 24,  Master: 28,  Legendary: 32.   </div><ul>
  <li>Critical Success: you create two of the item, the second of which can be used within the hour.  </li>  <li>Success, you create the item as expected, and it must be used by the end of your next turn.  </li>  <li>Failure, you do not create the item, and take -2 to further quick alchemy checks to create the same item for the next hour (cumulative). You can immediately spend the appropriate number of Advanced Alchemy points (assuming you have enough left) to create the item (though it still only lasts until the end of your next turn), but this doesn't remove the -2 penalty. </li>  <li>Critical failure:  you simply do not have the ingredients needed to create the item. Until you’ve had time to gather ingredients you cannot attempt to create the item again. The gathering components time is based on the tier of the item:
    <ul>
      <li>Trained: 1 hour</li>      <li>Expert: 3 hours</li>      <li>Master: 6 hours</li>      <li>Legendary: 12 hours</li>    </ul>  </li></ul></div>
