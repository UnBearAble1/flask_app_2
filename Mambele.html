<strong>Group</strong> Axe; <strong>Traits</strong> Deadly d8, Disarm, Thrown 20 ft., Uncommon</div><div><br /></div><div>Also known as a hunga munga or danisco, this hybrid knife-axe consists of a hilt and a blade that curves backward toward the wielder. The curve of the blade is such that after a victim has been struck by a mambele, more damage is dealt as the weapon is extracted from the victim’s body.</div><h2>Traits</h2><div><strong>Deadly d8:</strong></div><div>On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon's damage. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Disarm:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Thrown 20 ft.:</strong></div><div>You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon’s Range entry.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div></div>
