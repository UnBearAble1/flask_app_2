<div data-component-type="text"><div>Might measures your ability to perform tasks requiring physical strength and force. It also measures how much your character can carry and lift, and is a minimum requirement for wearing some armor. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Untrained Actions </strong></div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/force-open" target="_blank"><strong>Force Open</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate.</li>  <li><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/power-lift" target="_blank"><strong>Power Lift:</strong></a> You attempt to lift more than your normal maximum. </li>  <li><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/shove" target="_blank"><strong>Shove</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You push a creature away from you</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Bulk and Lifting Limits: </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Your character’s Bulk Limit determines how much weight they can comfortably carry. If they’re carrying a total amount of Bulk Limit they are <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/encumbered" target="_blank">encumbered</a>. A character can’t carry a total amount of Bulk that exceeds double their Bulk Limit. The Bulk your character is carrying equals the sum of all of their items; keep in mind that 10 light items make up 1 Bulk. </div><div><br /></div><div>A character's Bulk Limit is 5 + half their ranks in the Might skill, with a divider or multiplier based on their size: </div><ul>
  <li>Tiny: divided by 4 (round up to the nearest 10th, decimals allowing L weight items) </li>  <li>Small: divided by 2 (round up to the nearest 10th, decimals allowing L weight items) </li>  <li>Medium: multiplied by 1</li>  <li>Large: multiplied by 4</li>  <li>Huge: multiplied by 10</li>  <li>Gargantuan: multiplied by 20</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><em>Example:  A tiny creature with a might skill of 8 ranks has a Bulk Limit of 2.3 (5+4 = 9 base, divided by 4 for size is 2.25, rounded up- they could carry 2B and 3L worth of items), where as a huge creature with a might skill of 4 ranks has a Bulk Limit of 28 (5+2 = 7 base, multiplied by 4 for size). </em></div><div><br /></div><div>The same multiplier above are also used for appropriate sized equipment. A pixie's longsword would be 1/4th the bulk of a human's (3L) where as a huge plague giant's longsword would be 10x the bulk (10B). </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Maximum LIft: </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>A creature can lift 15kg per point of Bulk Limit they have. </div><div><br /></div><div><em>Example:  human with 2 ranks in might (above average) can lift 90 kg (198 lbs,) where as an Adult Green Dragon with a might of 12 ranks (possible for certain monsters) can lift 1,650 kg (3,670 lbs.) </em></div><div><br /></div><div>Using the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/power-lift" target="_blank">Power Lift</a> Athletics action can potentially double this number.</div></div>
