This pane can be set anywhere within range, angled in any fashion, but remains static once the spell is cast. The pane is completely intangible. It completely prevents vision from detecting anything on the other side, but nothing else.<br />

The warded pane appears to be an incongruous 'hole' in vision, and is easily spottable from a distance.  </div></div>
