The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection of the Material Plane).  Because this special edge of the Shadow Plane is still a physical space, it must be traversed normally, though the obstacles in the Material Plane may be entirely nonexistent in the Shadow Plane, and the latter may have entirely new ones. This spell provides you with neither special means of traversing obstacles in the Shadow Plane nor means of surviving the things you encounter there. You can use the same skills and abilities to successfully navigate in parallel with the Material Plane that you would to navigate the Material Plane itself, allowing you to make the same checks to find your way to your destination. </div><div><br /></div><div>The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 12 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target, and the process to fully fade from the Shadow Plane back to the Material Plane takes three rounds. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together).</div><div><br /></div><div>While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. Though the GM can interpret this however they wish, the suggestion is this: </div><div><br /></div><div>After roughly the first hour traveling via Shadow Walk, have the spell-caster make a DC 5 flat check. On a success, they have no special encounter. On a critical failure, they have a particularly challenging one. Each hour after the first, have them repeat this check, but increase the DC by 1 each time. Reset the DC back to 5 once an encounter is had. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
