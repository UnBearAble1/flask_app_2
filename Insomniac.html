Whenever such a bout occurs, roll a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, you lose two hours of sleep that night, and must either make it up (make another check to see if you can) or suffer the consequences (see <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/resting" target="_blank">Rest</a>.) Then the bout continues another night, until you make the flat check. If you roll a 1 on the flat check, you get no sleep that night. </div><div><br /></div><div>The value of this complication is based on the regularity of your episodes: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Mild: [-2 pts]</strong> The DM rolls a secret 1d20 check for how many days until your next bout. </li>  <li><strong>Severe: [-3 pts]</strong> The DM rolls a secret 1d10 check for how many days until your next bout. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Regardless of the severity, during times of prolonged stress the DM may require a flat check to see if your bout begins immediately. </div></div>
