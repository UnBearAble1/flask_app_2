<div data-component-type="text"><div>Armor increases your character’s defenses, but some medium or heavy armor can hamper movement. If you want to increase your character’s defense beyond the protection your armor provides, they can use a shield. Armor protects your character only while they’re wearing it.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Donning and Removing Armor </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Getting in and out of armor is time consuming—so make sure you’re wearing it when you need it! Donning and removing armor are both activities involving many Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5 minutes to don medium or heavy armor, and 1 minute to remove any armor.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Damaging Armor </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Most suits of armor and weapons are made from ordinary, commonly available materials like iron, leather, steel, and wood. If you’re not sure what a suit of armor is made of, the GM determines the details. Some armor, shields, and weapons are instead made of precious materials. These often have inherent supernatural properties. Cold iron, for example, which harms fey, and silver can damage werecreatures. </div><div><br /></div><div>Your armor’s statistics are based on the material it’s predominantly made from. It’s not likely your armor will take damage. </div></div><div data-component-type="table"><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th data-column-width="384"><div>Material</div></th><th data-column-width="130"><div>Hardness</div></th><th data-column-width="85"><div>HP</div></th><th data-column-width="101"><div>BT</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>Cloth (padded) </div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Leather (hide, leather, studded leather) </div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Metal (Breastplate, chain mail, chain shirt, half plate, scale mail, splint mail) </div></td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>36</div></td><td><div>18</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Dexterity Modifier Cap (Dex Cap) </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>This number is the maximum amount of your Dexterity modifier that can apply to your AC while you are wearing a given suit of armor.

If you meet the armor’s Strength threshold (see Strength below), you don’t take this penalty.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Speed Penalty </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>While wearing a suit of armor, you take the penalty listed in this entry to your Speed, as well as to any other movement types you have, such as a climb Speed or swim Speed, to a minimum Speed of 5 feet. If you meet the armor’s Strength threshold (see below), you reduce the penalty by 5 feet.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Strength </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>This entry indicates the Strength score at which you are strong enough to overcome some of the armor’s penalties. If your Strength is equal to or greater than this value, you no longer take the armor’s check penalty, and you decrease the Speed penalty by 5 feet (to no penalty if the penalty was –5 feet, or to a –5-foot penalty if the penalty was –10 feet).</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Bulk </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>This entry gives the armor's Bulk, assuming you're wearing the armor and distributing its weight across your body. A suit of armor that's carried usually has 1 more Bulk than what's listed here (or 1 Bulk total for armor of light Bulk).</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Group: </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Each type of medium and heavy armor belongs to an armor group, which classifies it with similar types of armor. Some abilities reference armor groups, typically to grant armor specialization effects,</div></div>
