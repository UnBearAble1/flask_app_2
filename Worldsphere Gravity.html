The effect persists for 1 minute.</div><ul>
  <li>Gravitational Morass: The pull of gravity is amplified here, creating greater difficult terrain. Flying creatures that pass through the area must succeed at a Reflex save against your spell DC or fall to the ground, taking bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen.</li>  <li>Flowing Time:  Erratic timestreams aid you within this space. A creature that starts its turn in the burst is affected by haste on that turn.</li></ul></div>
