Your wings are large and strong enough for flight. You gain a <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/kb/en/article/movement" target="_blank">fly speed</a> equal to your speed, but can only fly as long as you are using actions to do so. During any actions you are not using any type of movement, or at the end of your turn, you begin to glide down to the ground- gliding down 60 feet (you take no damage if you hit the ground.) Your wings have a wingspan of 150% your height. You need that much room to use them, and may be unable to use them otherwise.</div></div>
