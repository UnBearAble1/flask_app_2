Reaction; Frequency once per 10 minutes; Trigger You critically succeed at a saving throw against a foe’s spell, and that spell is of a level you can normally cast.</strong></div><div><br />
You absorb a spell and store it in your body. You can cast the triggering spell once during the next 10 minutes, even if it’s not on your spell list, as if it were in your repertoire. You cast the spell at the same spell level as the spell you absorbed, but the spell is of your magical tradition and uses your spell DC, spell attack roll, and other statistics to determine its effects. You have advantage on the roll to cast the spell.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+2 Points) Retain Absorbed Spell:</strong> You can choose to retain the absorbed spell for the next hour instead of the next 10 minutes; if you choose to extend the absorption to an hour, you can't use Absorb Spell again until one hour after the spell is absorbed.</div></div>
