Your skin develops a malleable, rubbery quality. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 2 + your number of Oozemorph feats. You also gain resistance equal to twice that amount to extra damage from critical hits; if the resistance is greater than the extra damage, it reduces the extra damage to 0 but doesn't reduce the attack's normal damage.</div></div>
