  <li>Quick Capture </li>  <li>Trigger A creature hits or touches the flytrap. </li>  <li>Effect The flytrap makes a leaf Strike against the triggering creature.

  <li>Leaf; Melee Single Action: +11 (+6 /+1) (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8+7 piercing plus 2d6 acid and<a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/improved-grab" target="_blank"> Improved Grab</a></li>  <li>Focused Assault; Two Actions: The flytrap attacks a single target with all four of its leaves. The flytrap makes one leaf Strike. On a success, the flytrap deals the damage from one leaf Strike plus an additional 1d8 damage for every leaf beyond the first (remember leaves used to grab aren't usable for anything else). On a failure, the flytrap deals the damage from one leaf Strike, but it can’t use Improved Grab. It deals no damage on a critical failure. This counts toward the flytrap’s multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of leaves the flytrap has.</li>  <li>Hungry Flurry; Two Actions; The flytrap makes four leaf Strikes at a –2 penalty, each against a different target. These attacks count toward the flytrap’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all its attacks.</li>  <li><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/swallow-whole-monster-ability" target="_blank">Swallow Whole</a>; Single Action (attack) Large, 2d8+3 bludgeoning plus 2d6 acid, Rupture 17</li></ul></div>
