During this movement, you can try to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an Acrobatics check against the enemy’s Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter its space.

  <li><strong>Success</strong> You move through the enemy’s space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure. Note that, unless you have an ability that states otherwise, this movement may still trigger reactions that trigger based on movement within reach. </li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.</li></ul></div>
