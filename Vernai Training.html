To resurrect (or reincarnate, or however they wish to restore them to life)  a creature you've slain, a spellcaster must <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/counteracting" target="_blank">counteract</a> your influence on its death (The DC of the skill you used to kill them.)
