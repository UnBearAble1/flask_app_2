This can be as complex or simple as you and the DM would like to design, and this complication is more of a catch-all for anything not otherwise listed here. Some examples may be: </div><ul>
  <li>You may never sleep at night [-2 pts] </li>  <li>You must always walk backwards [-5 pts] </li>  <li>Plants will rot and milk will curdle in your presence [-1 pt] </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>The DM should assign the point value of Divine Curse using existing complications as a guideline. The more encompassing or debilitating, the more point value. Price commandments as if they were vows. The terms of atonement for the curse should require great effort to discover and accomplish. </div><div><br /></div></div>
