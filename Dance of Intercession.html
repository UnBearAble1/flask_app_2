You can perform this dance up to three times per day. The second time you do so on the same day, use the degree of success one worse than your actual roll on the Performance check. The third time in a day, use the degree of success two lower than your actual roll.</div><ul>
  <li>Critical Success: You perform the movements of the Dance of Intercession so gracefully that you evoke a glimmer of the memory of the Celestial Dragon's awesome power. You cast the 3-action version of either a legendary-tier  <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/harm" target="_blank">harm</a> or <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/heal" target="_blank">heal</a> at any point during your Stride (even if you cannot normally cast legendary tier spells).  This does not require a spellcasting roll. </li>  <li>Success:  As critical success, but the spell is Master-Tier.</li>  <li>Failure:  As critical success, but the spell is Expert-Tier. </li>  <li>Critical Failure:  You fail to remember the steps of the dance. You gain no additional effect beyond Striding half your Speed, and you can't attempt the Dance of Intercession again until your next daily preparations.</li></ul></div>
