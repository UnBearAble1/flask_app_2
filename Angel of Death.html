All your Strikes against a creature you have Marked for Death have the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/death" target="_blank"><em>death</em></a> trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. When killed in this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract level is legendary (and it still must attempt to make a counteract roll), or originates from an artifact or a deity.</div></div>
