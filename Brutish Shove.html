Throwing your weight behind your attack, you hit your opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> with a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/shove" target="_blank">Shove</a> it, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesn’t trigger reactions. This Strike has the following failure effect. </div><ul>
  <li>Failure The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your current turn.</li></ul></div>
