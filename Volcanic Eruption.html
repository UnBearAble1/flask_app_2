The lava rapidly cools and encases creatures in the area. A creature encased in rock is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/clumsy" target="_blank">clumsy </a>1 and takes a –15-foot status penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/difficult-terrain" target="_blank">difficult terrain</a> to a flying creature, and such creatures immediately descend 20 feet the moment they're encased, but they don't take damage from this fall. A creature encased in rock can attempt to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/escape" target="_blank">Escape </a>against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock.</div><div><br /></div><div>Additionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet of the lava column automatically take 3d6 fire damage from the intense heat, regardless of the results of their saving throws.</div><div><br /></div><ul>
