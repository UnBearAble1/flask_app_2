The gem has 10 Hit Points. Each time a creature Strikes the target, the target attempts a DC 11 flat check. On a success, the gem blocks the attack, so the attack first damages the gem and then applies any remaining damage to the target. If the gem is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters, immediately dealing the creature that destroyed it 3d8 slashing damage (basic Reflex save), as long as that creature is within 10 feet of the target.</div><div><br /></div><div>Heightened: The gem has 10 additional HP, and the damage dealt by its detonation increases by 2d8.</div></div>
