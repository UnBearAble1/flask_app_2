Its strings are finely braided wires that run along its sturdy metal neck.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Shove: </strong>You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Two-Hand 1d8: </strong>This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. <br />
