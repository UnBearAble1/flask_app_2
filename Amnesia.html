You can buy off this complication when the DM allows it, based on the reason you got it. Maybe by encountering a particular person or situation, taking a blow to the head, or being triggered by a brainwashing condition. This complication has two versions: </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Partial Amnesia: [-1 pts] </strong></div><div>When you select this complication, the DM gets to select 10 points of background complications. You can select 5 points of ancestral complications (yes, this means that you actually get 1 more point than usual of complications, since partial amnesia gives you 1) You don’t know what those complications are, until they are revealed in play. Further, your character doesn’t remember where they learned the skills they have or how they got where they are, though they do know how to do everything your character can do (you can see your character sheet.) </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Total Amnesia: [-3 pts] </strong></div><div>You can describe what your character looks like, and assign your class points, but nothing else. The DM will build your character the rest of the way, including selecting 10 points of background complications and 5 points of ancestry complications (yes, this means that you actually get 3 more points than usual of complications, since total amnesia gives you 3.) You don’t get a copy of your character sheet, and don’t get to see your actual abilities, just make D20 rolls as needed and the DM will tell you if you pass or fail when you attempt things. </div><div><br /></div></div>
