The gases are invisible, requiring a successful Perception check against your spell DC to detect visually, though their acrid smell and toxic effects are clear once a creature has entered the cloud. A creature that enters the cloud or is within the cloud at the start of its turn takes 4d6 poison damage. A creature can take the poison damage from flammable fumes only once per round.</div><div><br /></div><div>One round after you conjure the cloud, the gases loses stability and become flammable. If an open flame is brought into the cloud, or if anyone within the area uses a fire effect, the cloud detonates in a massive blaze that deals 10d6 fire damage to all creatures within it, and the spell ends.</div><div><br /></div><div>Heightened: The poison damage increases by 1d6 and the fire damage on an explosion increases by 4d6.</div></div>
