You’ve dabbled in a variety of tricks, gaining minor magical abilities from a particular tradition. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic (it must be the one associated with the skill you met the prerequisites for this feat with) and gain two cantrips from the common cantrips available to that tradition. Use your appropriate knowledge skill associated with the Tradition in substitution for the Spellcaster skill for attacks, DCs, or other purposes, but if you do and the cantrip deals damage, you deal 1 dice less damage than normal. You can also choose to use CHR instead of the appropriate attribute when determining this number (just for the purposes of your cantrips.) </div></div>
