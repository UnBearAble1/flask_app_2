Choose one cantrip from the arcane list. You have a mystical rune on your body corresponds to the chosen cantrip, and you can cast the chosen cantrip as an innate arcane spell, and can choose to use  your Arcana Skill to determine its effectiveness instead of your Spellcaster skill (if you do, and it deals damage, it deals one dice less damage). For purposes of this cantrip, you can use your CHR instead of INT for determining your skill total. </div></div>
