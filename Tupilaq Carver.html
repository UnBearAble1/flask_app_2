Add the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/summon-construct" target="_blank">summon construct</a> spell to your spell repertoire. The constructs you summon have a distinct ivory scrimshaw appearance, and if you include a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature’s body as part of the spell’s material component, the summoned construct gains a +4 status bonus to Perception checks to sense or locate that creature.</div></div>
