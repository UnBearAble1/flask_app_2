  <li>Stabilize: Attempt a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/medicine-int" target="_blank">Medicine</a> check on a creature that has 0 Hit Points and the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/dying" target="_blank">dying</a> condition. The DC is equal to 5 + that creature’s recovery roll DC (typically 15 + its dying value).</li>  <li>Stop Bleeding: Attempt a Medicine check on a creature that is taking <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/persistent-damage" target="_blank">persistent</a> bleed damage, giving them a chance to make another flat check to remove the persistent damage. The DC is usually the DC of the effect that caused the bleed.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Outcomes based on your Medicine Check: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Success</strong> If you’re trying to stabilize, the creature loses the dying condition (but remains unconscious). If you’re trying to stop bleeding, the creature attempts a flat check to end the bleeding.</li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> If you were trying to stabilize, the creature’s dying value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, it immediately takes an amount of damage equal to its persistent bleed damage.</li></ul></div>
