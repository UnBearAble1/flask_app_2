You learn the Nudge Fate hex Cantrip<br />
<br />
<strong>Nudge Fate; Cantrip, Divination, Hex<br />
1 Action verbal; Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute</strong><br />
You read slightly into the future and give fate a tiny push to achieve the result you desire. Once during the duration, when the target fails an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw and a +1 status bonus would turn a critical failure into a failure, or failure into a success, you grant the target a +1 status bonus to the check retroactively, changing the outcome appropriately. The spell then ends, and the target is temporarily immune for 1 minute.<br />
<br />
If you cast nudge fate while a previous casting of this hex is still in effect, the previous effect ends.</div></div>
