Three factors determine the value of an Enemy: its power, its intent, and its frequency of appearance.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Power: </strong></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Minor</strong>: 1 Person, half as powerful as your character. [-1 pt] </li>  <li><strong>Moderate</strong>: 1 Person, as powerful as your character [-2 pts] </li>  <li><strong>Major</strong>: 1 Person, more powerful than your character, or a medium group of less-powerful people (6 to 20 people). [-4 pts] </li>  <li><strong>Extreme</strong>: An organization of people less powerful than your character (21 to 1000 people) or a medium group that includes some formidable or superhuman individuals.[-6 pts]</li>  <li><strong>Incredible</strong>: An incredibly formidable group (a cabal of powerful wizards, a whole government or the like) [-8pts]</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Special Considerations: </strong></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Unknown Enemy </strong>[additional -1 pt] </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Intent: </strong></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Watcher</strong>: Maybe a stalker, detectives that hound you, a journalist who tracks you constantly. This more annoying than dangerous [x1/4] </li>  <li><strong>Rival</strong>: They want harass or embarrass you, but will stop just short of doing actual harm [x1/2] </li>  <li><strong>Hunter</strong>: They are out to kill you or otherwise fully ruin you [x1] </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Frequency of Appearance: </strong>The DM rolls a flat check at the beginning of the session to see if the NPC shows up or is relevant to the session. </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Basically Constant: [x3] </strong>- the NPC is always around. No roll required. </li>  <li><strong>Almost All the Time: [x2]</strong> - the NPC is usually around, but has their own thing they regularly break off and do. Flat Check DC 6</li>  <li><strong>Fairly Often: [x1] </strong>- the NPC shows up regularly, but doesn’t live with you. Flat Check DC 10.</li>  <li><strong>Rarely: [x 1/2]</strong> - the NPC pops up now and again. Flat Check DC 15.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The DM has to decide how and when the enemies appear. Bear in mind they may completely take up the whole adventure, if they are powerful or persistent enough. You also may eventually defeat your enemy, maybe convincing them to change their ways, maybe killing them. If that is the case, you have a few options: </div><ul>
  <li>Buy off the disadvantage. Easy enough. </li>  <li>Take a disadvantage or disadvantages of equal value. Maybe you were injured permanently in the last fight? Maybe you got a phobia or other condition over the situation? </li>  <li>Take another enemy of equal value. Maybe the evil professor's sister? </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
