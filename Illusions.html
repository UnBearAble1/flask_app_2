<strong>Activation: Duration</strong></div><div><strong>[Mental],  Default Range: 10 feet </strong></div><div><strong>Linked Skill: Deception </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You can create Illusions: the semblance of something real, fooling the eyes, ears, and other senses. Depending on how the illusion is perceived, it might have the auditory or visual traits, and also have the mental trait. </div><div><br /></div><div>Illusions allow an affected creature a chance to disbelieve the effect, which lets the creature effectively ignore the effect if it succeeds at doing so. This usually happens when a creature Seeks or otherwise spends actions to engage with the illusion, comparing the result of its Perception check (or another check or saving throw, at the GM’s discretion) to the effect’s DC. </div><div><br /></div><div>If the illusion is visual, and a creature interacts with the illusion in a way that would prove it is not what it seems, the creature might know that an illusion is present, but it still can’t ignore the illusion without successfully disbelieving it. For instance, if a character is pushed through the illusion of a door, they will know that the door is an illusion, but they still can’t see through it. Disbelieving an illusion makes it and those things it blocks seem hazy and indistinct, so even in the case where a visual illusion is disbelieved, it may, at the GM’s discretion, block vision enough to make those on the other side concealed.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you attempt to modify an unwilling creature with an illusion, they get a Will saving throw. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Dynamics</strong>: </div><ul>
  <li>You always create the same exact illusion, with the same exact measurements, though with GM approval you can alter it slightly to fit into space. Audio illusions of this type or exactly the same each time, such as the same song, the same shout or sound.  (Base: 4. Mod +2) </li>  <li>You always create the same type of illusion, though can alter its size, cosmetics, or measurements up to the maximum size you purchased. Audio illusions are the same type, such as “music” or “shouting” or “battle”  (Base: 8, Mod +4) </li>  <li>You always create similar categories of illusions, such as creatures, objects, or scenery (Base: 12, Mod +12) </li>  <li>You can create any single object or creature or change of scenery that matches the features you purchased below (Base: 16, Mod +14) </li>  <li>You can create multiple objects, creatures, or changes in scenery that match the features you purchased below, and that can fit within the dimensions you specified.  (Base: 16, Mod +34) </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Senses Impacted: </div><ul>
  <li>Sight only (visual)  (default) </li>  <li>Hearing only (auditory) (mod -4) </li>  <li>Touch only (mod -12) </li>  <li>Smell/Taste only (mod -16) </li>  <li>Any senses (Mod +10) <br />
</li></ul><div>Complexity / Autonomy: </div><ul>
  <li>Your illusions are simple, lacking any specificity. They can be programmed with simple, repetitive motion. Examples: A non-specific human in generic clothing, a simple tree swaying in the wind (though even if the wind stops, the animation keeps repeating), a patch of simple ground, a wordless cry or shout (default) </li>  <li>Your illusions can have moderate specificity, and can have slightly interactive animations. Examples: A non-specific human of a particular ethnicity in a particular uniform. A tree that bends and bows naturally with the wind, or if touched. A portion of wall that matches the color and texture of the surrounding wall. A nonspecific voice saying something. (Mod +6) </li>  <li>Your illusions can have incredibly nuanced complexity, or deeply interactive programming. Examples: A specific person, A tree that can mimic the movements of someone nearby, a hole in a wall that appears to show what is happening beyond it (but isn’t actually doing so), the voice of a specific person speaking  (Mod +20) <br />
</li></ul><div>Default maximum Dimension</div><ul>
  <li>A 1x1x1 foot cube, barely audible/detectable sound / smell / taste (Mod -4) </li>  <li>A 2.5 foot burst, volume of sound / smell / taste normally available from a single person or item (default) </li>  <li>A 5 foot burst, volume of sound / smell / taste normally available from a group of 5 people or items (Mod +4) </li>  <li>A 10 foot burst, volume of  sound / smell / taste normally available from a group of 10 people or items (Mod +7) </li>  <li>A 15 foot burst, volume of sound / smell / taste normally available from a  group of 20 people or items (Mod +10) </li>  <li>A 20 foot burst, volume of sound / smell / taste normally available from a crowd of 40 people or items (Base +4, Mod +10) </li>  <li>A 25 foot burst,  volume of sound / smell / taste normally available from 80 people or items (Base +4, Mod +20) </li>  <li>A 30 foot burst, volume of sound / smell / taste normally available from a crowd of 160 people or items (Base +8, Mod +20) </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Special Modifiers: </div><ul>
  <li>Obvious: Your illusion isn’t designed to actually trick anyone, but rather as a tactical or cosmetic element. For example, the ability to generate a 3d map that hovers in the air, or to create accompanying music for your singing performance, or mystical graffiti. (Mod -14) </li>  <li>Modifies creature or object: Your illusion is attached to a creature or object, modifying how they look, sound, feel or smell/taste. If the creature moves, the illusion moves with them.  (Mod +4) </li>  <li>Modifies Actions: Your illusion can make one action a creature is taking appear to be another type of action. For example, you can use an illusion to disguise the fact that your party is drawing their weapons as them shaking hands and discussing things with one another. Hostile actions end this effect automatically. (Mod +6) </li>  <li>Real: Your illusion lacks the mental trait, as the sensory effects are actually occurring, not just in the mind of the recipient. Your illusion can still be overcome by disbelief, but it affects creatures otherwise immune to mental affects. It can block creatures fully from passage (unless they disbelieve). Creatures who interact with your illusions can still use perception to disbelieve. (Mod +20) </li>  <li>Selective: You can select which creatures are affected by your illusion. (Mod +6) </li>  <li>Limited to One: Only a single creature can be affected by each use of your illusion. (Mod -10) </li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Bolster Illusions</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>[Base: 8] </strong></div><div><strong>Activation: Instantaneous</strong></div><div><strong>[Mental], Default Range: 30 feet</strong></div><div><strong>Default Action: reaction </strong></div><div>As a reaction, when a creature disbelieves an illusion, you can cause it to still believe. It may still get an attempt to disbelieve when it interacts again, but otherwise organically believes the illusion.<br />
