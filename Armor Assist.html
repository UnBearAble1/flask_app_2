After your service aiding armored combatants, you are practiced in helping yourself and others don heavy gear. You can attempt an Athletics or Warfare Lore check with a DC determined by the GM (but usually Trained for common armor, Expert for uncommon armor, and Master for rare armor) to halve the time you take to don armor. You can halve an ally's time to don armor by working with them to don the armor and succeeding at an Athletics or Warfare Lore check against the same DC.</div></div>
