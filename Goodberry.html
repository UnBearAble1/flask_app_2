<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>6 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Nature; Focus Spell</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: Master in Nature</strong><br />
You gain the goodberry order spell, and you increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.<br />
<br />
<strong>Goodberry; Healing, Necromancy</strong></div><div><strong>Special: This Focus Spell takes 2 Focus Points to Cast </strong><br />
<strong>2 Actions somatic, verbal; Range touch; Targets 1 to 3 ripe berries; Duration 10 minutes</strong><br />
You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an Interact action to regain 1d6+4 Hit Points (Expert-Tier effect).  A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single Interact action.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Special</strong>: You can cast this spell as a Master-Tier effect (which also enchants an extra berry). If you are Legendary tier, you can cast this as a Legendary-Tier effect (which enchants two extra berries), but it costs 3 Focus Points. If you use either of these options, you cannot use either again until you have completed 2d4 full rests. </div></div>
