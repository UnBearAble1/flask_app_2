You weave dispelling energy into a spell, sending both effects at a foe. If your next action is to cast a single-target spell against a creature, and you either hit the foe with the spell attack roll or the foe fails its saving throw, you can cast <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/dispel-magic" target="_blank">dispel magic</a> on the foe as a free action, casting it as normal and targeting one spell effect affecting the foe.</div></div>
