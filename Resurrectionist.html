You can cause a creature you bring back from the brink of death to thrive and continue healing. When you restore Hit Points to a dying creature or bring a dead creature back to life and restore Hit Points to it, you grant that creature <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/healing" target="_blank">fast healing</a> 5 for 1 minute. This fast healing ends if the creature is knocked unconscious, and the healing effect is considered one tier lower than the spell or effect you used to heal the creature. </div></div>
