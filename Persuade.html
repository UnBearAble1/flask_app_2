Choose an NPC, and attempt a skill check to persuade that NPC (Deception if you use guile and manipulation, Diplomacy if you use charm or flattery, or Intimidation if your use force of will or aggression.) The DC, and whether success is possible, depend on the NPC's motivations, their disposition toward you, and the approach you take. </div><div><br />
<strong>Critical Success</strong> You persuade the NPC to the maximum degree possible with your approach, and their disposition toward you improves by one.<br />
<strong>Success</strong> You persuade the NPC within the confines of your approach.<br />
<strong>Failure</strong> You fail to persuade the NPC.<br />

Aid still only provides a bonus to the primary persuader, it doesn't reduce or increase the difficulty tier. </div></div>
