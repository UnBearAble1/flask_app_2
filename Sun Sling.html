<strong>Ammunition</strong> <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/sun-shot" target="_blank">Sun Shot</a></div><div><strong>Group</strong> Sling; <strong>Traits</strong> Concussive, Propulsive, Uncommon</div><div><br /></div><div>A sun sling is a small staff with a head of woven netting. The staff is small enough to hold in a single hand, making it useful for hit-and-run tactics, but once loaded with ammunition, it requires two hands to properly swing and fire. This is a martial ranged weapon.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Concussive:</strong></div><div>These weapons smash as much as puncture. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Propulsive:</strong></div><div>You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div></div>
