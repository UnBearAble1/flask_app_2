Generally, a check is not required to identify relatively simple technological items that are commonly available. </div><div><br /></div><div>Once you discover that an item, location, or ongoing effect is technological in nature, you can spend 10 minutes to try to identify the particulars of it. If your attempt is interrupted, you must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check. Highly unusual or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might even be impossible to identify using this activity alone. </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Critical Success</strong> You learn all the attributes of the technology, including how it works, what it does, any means of activating it (for an item or location), and whether it is functioning properly.</li>  <li><strong>Success</strong> You get a sense of what it does and learn any means of activating it. You can’t try again in hopes of getting a critical success.</li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to identify the technology and can’t try again for 1 day.</li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You misidentify the technology as something else of the GM’s choice.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
