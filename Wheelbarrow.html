You can raise or place a wheelbarrow using an Interact action and can Stride your normal Speed while you have the wheelbarrow raised, though you're encumbered while pushing a wheelbarrow. You can Release a wheelbarrow as normal, but a loaded wheelbarrow has a chance of tipping over if you don't place it down with care. When you Release a wheelbarrow, attempt a DC 7 flat check. On a failure, the wheelbarrow tips over, spilling its contents into a randomly determined adjacent space.</div></div>
