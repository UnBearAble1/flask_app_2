When you try to sneak a concealed object past someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stealth-dex" target="_blank">Stealth</a> check and compares it to this passive observer’s Perception DC. Once the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same result is used no matter how many passive observers you try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your Stealth DC (finding the object on success).</div><div><br /></div><div>You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth DC to determine whether they find the object.</div><ul>
  <li><strong>Success</strong> The object remains undetected.</li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> The searcher finds the object.</li></ul></div>
