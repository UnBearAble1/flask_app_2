<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 7 </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Verdurous oozes are found in temperate forests, warm jungles, or other places where plant life grows in abundance. Unlike many types of oozes, verdurous oozes are not particularly good climbers and have been known to get trapped in natural or artificial chasms. Warlords and wizards sometimes make use of that fact and keep verdurous oozes as guardians in pits around the walls of their fortresses or towers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Ooze (Occultism)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Medium, Mindless, Ooze, Lurker </strong></div><div>Perception +11; motion sense 60 feet, no vision</div><ul>

  <li>Corrosive Surface: A creature that hits a verdurous ooze with a metal weapon or unarmed attack must attempt a DC 21 Reflex save. On a failure, the weapon or creature takes 2d4 acid damage (after dealing damage to the ooze as normal). Thrown weapons take this damage automatically with no save.</li>  <li>Enliven Foliage (aura, primal, transmutation) 20 feet. The verdurous ooze constantly emits supernatural vapors that cause nearby plants to grow rapidly and writhe and grasp at anything and everything within the emanation. This area becomes <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/difficult-terrain" target="_blank">difficult terrain</a> for non–verdurous ooze creatures.
