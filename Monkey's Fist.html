You can tie the loose end of a monkey's fist to your wrist; if you are <a data-composite="true" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=41" target="">Disarmed</a>, the weapon remains secured to your wrist rather than falling to the ground, though you must use an Interact action to grip it before using it again. A monkey's fist is a martial melee weapon.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Monk:</strong></div><div>A weapon with this trait is primarily used by those who favor the Ki Arts. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Nonlethal:</strong></div><div>An effect with this trait is not inherently deadly. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.</div></div>
