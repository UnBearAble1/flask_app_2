Prerequisites: Trained in Professional</strong><br />
</div><div>You've trained your brain to make the most of your limited time. You gain the following benefits: </div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li>For 3 actions, you can quickly memorize an inscription, scroll, or other piece of writing you can clearly see whose length is equivalent to no more than one page. You can then accurately recreate this writing using a writing kit, wax tablet, or other writing medium, once you have reached safety. You don't need to understand the writing or identify the language to reproduce it. Your memory lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations; if you have not written down or otherwise recreated what you saw by this point, your memory fades and any attempt to recreate what you saw is garbled and unintelligible. You can have only one piece of writing memorized at a time; any previous memorization fades the next time you use this ability.</li>  <li>For 24 hours after learning a prominent fact—such as the name of an NPC you have met, the details of your mission briefing, and similar information—you can recall it without attempting a check, though this doesn’t allow you to automatically memorize long strings of numbers or text.</li>  <li>You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to remember a detail that has come up before in the current adventure, even if it was more than 24 hours ago. If you have the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/thorough-reports" target="_blank">Thorough Reports</a> feat and have expert proficiency in the skill you’re using to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a>, your circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures from that feat increases to +4.</li></ul></div>
