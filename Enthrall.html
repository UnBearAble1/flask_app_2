You speak or sing without interruption throughout the casting and duration. Targets who notice your speech or song might give their undivided attention; each target must attempt a Will save. The GM might grant a circumstance bonus (to a maximum of +4) if the target is of an opposing religion, ancestry, or political leaning, or is otherwise unlikely to agree with what you're saying.</div><div><br /></div><div>Each creature that comes within range has to attempt a save when you Sustain the Spell.

  <li>Critical Success The target is unaffected and notices that you tried to use magic.</li>  <li>Success The target needn't pay attention but doesn't notice you tried to use magic (it might notice others are enthralled).</li>  <li>Failure The target is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/fascinated" target="_blank">fascinated</a> with you. It can attempt another Will save if it witnesses actions or speech with which it disagrees. If it succeeds, it's no longer fascinated and is temporarily immune for 1 hour. If the target is subject to a hostile act, or if another creature succeeds at a Diplomacy or Intimidation check against it, the fascination ends immediately.</li>  <li>Critical Failure As failure, but the target can't attempt a save to end the fascination if it disagrees with you.</li></ul></div>
