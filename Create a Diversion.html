If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/manipulate" target="_blank">manipulate</a> trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/auditory" target="_blank">auditory</a> and <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/linguistic" target="_blank">linguistic</a> traits.</div><div><br /></div><div>Attempt a single <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/deception-chr" target="_blank">Deception</a> check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.</div><ul>
  <li><strong>Success</strong> You become <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/hidden" target="_blank">hidden</a> to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to Sneak away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/step" target="_blank">Step</a> or use the Hide or the Sneak action of the Stealth skill. If you <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> a creature, the creature remains <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> against that attack, and you then become <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/observed" target="_blank">observed</a>. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.</li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.</li></ul></div>
