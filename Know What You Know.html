Your checks to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a> are no longer secret. If an effect (such as <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/dubious-knowledge" target="_blank">Dubious Knowledge</a>) would give you inaccurate information from your Recall Knowledge check, you know which information is inaccurate. When one of your allies Recalls Knowledge and gains false information, you also know that information is inaccurate if they share it with you.</div></div>
