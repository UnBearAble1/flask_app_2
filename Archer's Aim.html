You slow down, focus, and take a careful shot. Make a ranged Strike with a weapon in the bow weapon group. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a> condition. If the target is hidden, reduce the flat check from being hidden from 11 to 5.</div></div>
