<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6 </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Ogre gluttons take the act of feeding to a horrific extreme, capable of extending their already cavernous mouths wide enough to gulp down a halfling. Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent “games” that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Humanoid (Society)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CE, Large, Giant, Humanoid</strong></div><div>Perception +8; low-light vision</div><div>Languages: Jotun</div><div>Skills: Athletics +8, Intimidation +6, Survival +2</div><div><strong>Str +6, Dex -1, Con +4, Int -2, Wis +0, Cha -2</strong></div><div><strong>AC 19; Fort +11 , Ref +7 , Will +9</strong></div><div><strong>HP 90</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 30 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>: </div><ul>
