It typically includes a chain shirt, leggings, a pair of arms, and a coif, collectively protecting most of the body.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Flexible: </strong>The armor is flexible enough that it doesn't hinder most actions. You don't apply its check penalty to Acrobatics or Athletics checks.</div><div><strong>Noisy: </strong>This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor's check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you meet the required Strength score.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Armor Specialization Effect</strong> (Granted by some feats and other abilities when wearing medium or heavy armor)</div><div><strong>Chain</strong>: The armor is so flexible it can bend with a critical hit and absorb some of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits by either 4 for medium armor, or 6 for heavy armor. This can’t reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit.</div></div>
