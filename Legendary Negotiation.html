You can negotiate incredibly quickly in adverse situations. You attempt to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/make-an-impression" target="_blank">Make an Impression</a> and then <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/request" target="_blank">Request</a> your opponent cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You take a –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances—it’s generally at least a Master DC -- Some creatures might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence.</div></div>
