When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes 2d8 persistent bleed damage. The target becomes <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a>, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.</div></div>
