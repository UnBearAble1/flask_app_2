<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat 7</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Thought to be the result of a failed experiment meant to animate objects or a sinister alghollthu creation, mimics are clever monsters that can take the form of common manufactured objects. Mimics are ambush predators and voracious eaters, surprising their prey through their uncanny ability to mimic the form of common furniture and miscellany. They remain disguised until unsuspecting adventurers happen by, then they lash out in ambush.</div><div><br /></div><div>Mimics possess complex alien minds, and while often cruel and self-serving, they also enjoy conversation with their prey from time to time. For unknown reasons, they are especially interested in humanoids. Mimics have a strong dislike for others of their kind and tend to live alone. A mimic can remain in its alternate form for an extremely long period of time, sometimes remaining disguised in a dungeon chamber for decades. Regardless of how long it waits, the mimic remains vigilant and alert, ready to strike at any moment.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Aberration (Occultism)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Medium, Aberration, Beefy</strong></div><div>Perception +12; darkvision</div><div>Languages Common</div><div>Skills Athletics +15, Deception +4, Dwelling Lore +6 (applies only to the dungeon it lives in)</div><div>Str +4, Dex +1, Con +3, Int +0, Wis +1, Cha +0</div><div><strong>AC 24; Fort +15, Ref +9, Will +12</strong></div><div><strong>HP: 140 </strong></div><div><strong>Speed 20 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features: </strong></div><div>Adhesive: The mimic is coated in an adhesive slime. Any creature that hits the mimic, is hit by the mimic, or otherwise touches the mimic must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save or become <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/grabbed" target="_blank">grabbed</a> (Escape DC 23). A weapon that hits the mimic is stuck to the mimic and can be removed with a successful DC 23 Athletics check (made as a single action). A mimic can have any number of objects or creatures stuck to it at a time. The mimic can release a stuck creature or object by using a single action, and the adhesive dissolves 1 minute after the mimic dies, releasing all stuck objects and creatures.</div><div><br /></div><div>Madness Field: Seeing the Mimic unfold from a small size to a larger size is maddening. DC 23 Will Save <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/confusion" target="_blank">confusion</a> effect -- weaker minds may be driven traditionally mad instead. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reaction:</strong></div><ul>
  <li>Object Lesson 
    <ul>
      <li>Trigger: A creature touches or physically interacts with the mimic while the mimic is transformed using Mimic Object.</li>      <li>The triggering creature is automatically stuck by the mimic’s adhesive (it receives no save). The mimic then makes a pseudopod Strike against any creature adjacent to the mimic. Object Lesson can’t be used again until the mimic escapes and takes on a new disguise.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Human Shield 
    <ul>
      <li>Trigger: A creature targets the mimic with a single target effect or an area effect that allows a reflex save</li>      <li>Requires: The mimic has a creature grabbed </li>      <li>Effect: The mimic uses its grabbed creature as a human shield. This uses the same rules as <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/shield-block" target="_blank">Shield Block</a>, except the person is used in place of a shield. For these purposes, the Mimic doesn't start taking damage until after the shield has taken 20 points of damage. </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions: </strong></div><ul>
  <li>Pseudopod, Melee Single Action, Reach 15,  +14 (+9/+4), Damage 2d8+14 bludgeoning plus adhesive</li>  <li>Human Flail, Melee Single Action (must have one creature grabbed), Reach 20, +14 (+9/+4), Damage 2d8+14 bludgeoning (damages both creatures, but grabbed creature only gets a basic fortitude save against the damage the first creature takes) </li>  <li>Raise Human Shield, Single Action: The Mimic uses an action and gets +2 to AC by using a human shield (must have someone grabbed, cannot use human flail and human shield unless it has 2 creatures grabbed) </li>  <li>Mimic Object, Single Action, (concentrate, polymorph): The mimic assumes the shape of any Medium object. This doesn't change the mimic's texture or overall size but can alter its coloration and visual appearance. It has an automatic result of 32 on Deception checks and DCs to pass as the object that it's mimicking.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Elite Free Actions:</strong> </div><ul>
  <li>Lash Out: Reach 15, the Mimic attacks up to three creatures within its reach. Basic Reflex save, DC 23, 4d8 damage and includes defense against Adhesive. </li>  <li>Bizarre Morphology: The Mimic undulates in a chaotic manner, causing madness in an area. Treat as the Madness Field </li>  <li>Turtle Up: The Mimic turns into an iron safe or massive anvil. Until the end of its next turn, it is Stunned. Creatures grabbed by it are now stuck to the outside of it, but may escape. However, it gains DR 20 and Fast Healing 30 - it morphs back into its normal form afterward, at the beginning of its available turn. </li></ul></div>
