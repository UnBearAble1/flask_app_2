You gain a +2 status bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to Shove or Trip you. You can <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/shove" target="_blank">Shove</a> creatures even if you don’t have a hand free. When you successfully Shove a foe, you can <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stride" target="_blank">Stride</a> away from your opponent (instead of toward it), but you must move the same distance in the opposite direction from where you Shoved it.</div></div>
