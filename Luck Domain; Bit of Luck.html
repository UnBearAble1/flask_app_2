You’re unnaturally lucky and keep out of harm’s way. You gain the following Focus Spell, and increase your Focus Point Pool by 1.<br />
<strong><br />
Bit of Luck; Divination, Fortune<br />
2 Actions somatic, verbal; Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature; Duration 1 minute</strong><br />
You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends.<br />
<br />
If you cast bit of luck again, any previous bit of luck you cast that's still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted with bit of luck, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.</div></div>
