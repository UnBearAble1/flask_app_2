Typically, larger sizes increase the number of squares you count as flanking support for, give you longer reach, and increase your lifting and carrying capacity. </div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Increased Size </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br />

<strong>Tiny<br />
[Base: 4] </strong></div><div>You are tiny, typically about 1 foot tall. You take up less than one square on the battlemap, and can only reach creatures in the same square you occupy. </div><ul>
  <li>You can enter another creature's space, which is important because your melee Strikes typically have no reach, meaning you must enter their space to attack them. Like other Tiny creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to Take Cover. </li>  <li>You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size. Tiny melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a reach 5 feet shorter than normal if they have the reach trait), and Tiny ranged weapons have their range limits reduced to 1/10th. Finally, most non-artillery weapons only deal 1 point of damage. Remember to adjust the Bulk of items and your Bulk limit for Tiny size, as well as your lifting capacity. <br />

<strong>Diminutive: </strong></div><div><strong>[Base: 8] </strong></div><div>You are diminutive - a size typically limited to bugs and the like. You have all the same traits as Tiny, but different bulk and carrying capacity, and you cannot deal physical damage with normal strikes. <br />
