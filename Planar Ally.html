While performing this ritual, the secondary casters entreat your deity, explaining what sort of assistance you need and why you need it; if the task is incredibly fitting to your deity, the GM can grant a circumstance bonus to the secondary Diplomacy check or rule that the check is automatically a critical success. If the ritual succeeds, the servitor will request you retrieve a specific item required for mysterious divine purpose, which can be done after the Planar Ally task is completed. Once the Planar Ally's duration is up, you are compelled by a legendary level <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/geas" target="_blank">geas</a> to retrieve the item. The difficulty of retrieving this item will be based on the length and difficulty of the task you require of the servitor. If you use the ritual without good reason, the result is automatically a critical failure.</div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li>Critical Success: Your deity sends a servitor, and the servitor’s payment costs only half as much as normal.

You must conduct an <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/atone" target="_blank">atone</a> ritual to regain your former standing with your deity.</li></ul></div>
