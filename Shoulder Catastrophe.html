You’ve trained to protect your allies by diverting the worst attacks to yourself. The enemy doesn’t double the damage from the triggering <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> but instead applies the normal damage to both you and your ally. Both of you take any effects that would happen on a hit that dealt damage, such as poison, but neither of you are subject to any effects that would happen only on a critical success.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+2 Points) Stave Off Catastrophe:</strong> When you use the Shoulder Catastrophe reaction, you can choose to take the full critical damage and effects from the attack, including effects that apply on a critical hit, and have your ally take no damage and avoid the attack's effects.</div></div>
