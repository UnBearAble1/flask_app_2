Your shadow magic bleeds into the space around you. Whenever you cast a spell with the darkness trait, a lingering aura of shadows reduces bright light within a 5-foot emanation around you to dim light until the end of your turn. Like in natural dim light, you can use these shadows to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/hide" target="_blank">Hide</a>, but the aura still makes your overall position obvious, so you can't become undetected through the use of these shadows alone.</div></div>
