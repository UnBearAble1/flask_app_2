You gain the Elemental Tempest school spell, and you increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.<br />
<br />
<strong>Elemental Tempest; Evocation, Metamagic<br />
1 Action ; verbal</strong><br />
Your spellcasting surrounds you in a storm of elemental energy. If the next action you take is to Cast a non-cantrip arcane spell that's an evocation spell dealing acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, a 10-foot emanation of energy surrounds you as you cast the spell. Foes in the area take 2d6 damage per teir of the spell you just cast of the same damage type the spell deals (choose one if it deals multiple types). Combine the damage from both elemental tempest and the other spell against foes who take damage from both before applying bonuses, penalties, resistance, weakness, and the like.</div></div>
