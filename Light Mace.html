<strong>Group</strong> Club; <strong>Traits</strong> Agile, Finesse, Shove</div><div><br /></div><div>A light mace has a short wooden or metal shaft ending with a dense metal head. Used much like a club, it delivers heavy bludgeoning blows, but with extra power derived from the head’s metal ridges or spikes.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Shove:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div></div>
