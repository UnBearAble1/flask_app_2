You have learned to manipulate the innate power of your bloodline and adapt it to your needs. When making your daily preparations, you can swap out a single spell in your repertoire for another spell of the same level. You can’t swap out spells granted specifically by your bloodline, and the swap must be from your tradition.</div></div>
