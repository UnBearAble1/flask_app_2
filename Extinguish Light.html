You wrap shadow around a single unattended light source within 120 feet that's no larger than a torch. Any non-magical light source you target is automatically extinguished. For magical light sources, attempt a <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/counteracting" target="_blank">counteract </a>check using your Fortitude or Thievery modifier against the target's DC. Successfully counteracting the light source suppresses its ability to produce light for 1 minute, but not any other effects. If you're in dim light or darkness when you Extinguish Light, its range is 240 feet.</div></div>
