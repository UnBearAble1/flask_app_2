Triple the distance you <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/long-jump" target="_blank">Long Jump</a> (so you could jump 60 feet on a successful DC 20 check). When you <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/high-jump" target="_blank">High Jump</a>, use the calculation for a Long Jump but don't triple the distance.<br />
<br />
You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you Long Jump or High Jump. For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the limit on how far you can Leap. (Note, this is the limit, not a free bonus)</div></div>
