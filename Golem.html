<div data-component-type="text"><div>Golems are a special type of construct. </div><div><br /></div><div>Golem's possess a potent type of antimagic, rendering them completely immune to all magic, with the exceptions being the three types listed in their antimagic field. Those are typically: </div><ul>
  <li>Harmed By: Non cantrip spells of this element or type deal the amount of damage listed in this field. If the golem is threat level 5+, the spell type must be expert or above. If the Golem is threat level 9+, the spell must be master or above. </li>  <li>Healed By: Non cantrip spells of this element or type heal the Golem the amount of damage listed. </li>  <li>Slowed By: Non cantrip spells of this element or type give the Golem the slowed 1 condition. If successfully struck by three or more spells of this type in a single round, it is slowed 2 (successfully struck meaning the spell would have otherwise done damage). </li></ul></div>
