<strong>Group</strong> Knife; <strong>Traits</strong> Agile, Disarm, Finesse, Monk, Parry, Twin, Uncommon, Versatile P</div><div><br /></div><div>This large, flat steel ring features several protruding blades typically stylized to resemble flames.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Disarm:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Monk:</strong></div><div>A weapon with this trait is primarily used by those who favor the Ki Arts.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Parry:</strong></div><div>This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend a single action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Twin:</strong></div><div>These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don’t need to have the same enchantments.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Versatile P:</strong></div><div>A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.</div></div>
