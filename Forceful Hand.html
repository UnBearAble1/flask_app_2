Each time you Sustain the Spell, the hand moves to an unoccupied space of your choice adjacent to you. When you Sustain the Spell, you can have the hand Fly to an unoccupied space of your choice adjacent to an ally to protect that ally instead. The hand's movement does not trigger reactions based on creature movement.</div><div><br /></div><div>Successful attacks against the hand damage it, and damaging effects that can target a creature can target the hand. The hand has an AC of 20, 50 Hit Points, and can't recover HP by any means. A hit by a disintegrate spell or similar effect destroys the hand.</div><div><br /></div><div>The hand's actions and the cover it provides depend on what actions you take during your turn. At the end of your turn, what the hand does is determined by the first entry on this list that matches a trait from any of the actions you used on your turn. For instance, if you <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/step" target="_blank">Step</a>, <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stride" target="_blank">Stride</a>, and Sustain the Spell, you use the entry for move actions, so the hand provides standard cover.</div><div><br /></div><ul>
