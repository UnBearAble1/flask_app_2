You can use Deception to weave traps to trip up anyone trying to deceive you. If you can engage in conversation with someone trying to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/lie" target="_blank">Lie</a> to you, use your Deception DC if it is higher than your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. This doesn’t apply if you don’t have a back-and-forth dialogue, such as when someone attempts to Lie during a long speech.</div></div>
