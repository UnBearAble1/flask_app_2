<strong>Group</strong> Club; <strong>Traits</strong> Agile, Nonlethal, Thrown 20 ft</div><div><br /></div><div>A juggling club is lighter than a typical club and balanced to be easily caught and thrown again by a juggler. While a juggling club deals less damage, the extra throwing distance its light weight allows is important for Juggling.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agile: </strong>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Nonlethal: </strong>An effect with this trait is not inherently deadly. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Thrown 20 ft.: </strong>You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon’s Range entry.</div></div>
