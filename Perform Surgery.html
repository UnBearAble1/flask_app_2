Make a  <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/medicine-int" target="_blank">Medicine</a> check. The DC is 25 for a serious wound, and 30 for a grievous one. </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Critical Success:</strong> You repair the injury, setting or reattaching the limb, stopping the internal bleeding, or the like. This fully removes the wound, though some effects may require magic to fully recover from. </li>  <li><strong>Success</strong>: You move the injury in the right direction. There are three options: 
    <ul>
      <li>If the patient remains resting in your care for 24 hours, you can attempt this roll again with a +4 to the check (until you critically succeed, fail or critically fail, this bonus continues to stack each day.) </li>      <li>You reduce the number of full rest requirements before the natural healing flat check can be made by 2. </li>      <li>If the patient is currently in the stage of natural recovery where they are making flat checks, they immediately succeed. </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong>: You fail to improve the injury. </li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> You actually make the injury worse. Increase the DC to perform future surgery on the injury by 4, and increase the number of full rests required before a natural flat check by 2. </li></ul><div><br /></div></div>
