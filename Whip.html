<strong>Group</strong> Flail; <strong>Traits</strong> Disarm, Finesse, Nonlethal, Reach, Trip</div><div><br /></div><div>This long strand of thick leather, often braided, delivers a painful but nonlethal slash at a distance, usually accompanied by a distinctive cracking sound.</div><h2>Traits</h2><div><strong>Disarm:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Nonlethal:</strong></div><div>An effect with this trait is not inherently deadly. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reach:</strong></div><div>Natural attacks with this trait can be used to attack creatures up to the listed distance away instead of only adjacent creatures. Weapons with this trait are long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Trip:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div></div>
