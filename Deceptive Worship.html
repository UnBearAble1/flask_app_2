Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead of <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/deception-chr" target="_blank">Deception</a> to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/impersonate" target="_blank">Impersonate</a> a typical worshipper of another faith or to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/lie" target="_blank">Lie</a> specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.</div></div>
