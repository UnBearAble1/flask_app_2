If your <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> with a poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your Strike being a critical failure, for example), attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned. If your Strike with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.</div></div>
