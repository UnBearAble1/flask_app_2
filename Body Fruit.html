<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>5 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Natural Abilities; Healing and HP</strong></div><div>Your body continually produces small fruits imbued with primal magic. At dawn each day, a new fruit ripens. You or an ally can remove this fruit as an Interact action. If a living creature that can derive sustenance from fruit consumes it as an Interact action within the next hour, they regain 5d8 Hit Points.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is an Expert-Tier effect. You can at any moment take an action to fortify your body fruit, increasing its healing capabilities to a Master-Tier effect (also increasing the healing to 7d8). Once you do so, you cannot grow Body Fruit again until you have taken 2d4 full rests. </div></div>
