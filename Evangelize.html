You point out a detail that incontrovertibly supports your faith, causing a listener’s mind to whirl. Attempt a Diplomacy check and compare the result to the Will DC of a single target that can hear you and understands your language; that target is then temporarily immune to Evangelize with respect to your deity or philosophy for 1 day. A creature that already agrees with you is unaffected, and at the GM’s discretion, a target that genuinely changes its perspective to support your faith as a result of the argument is also otherwise unaffected.</div><ul>
  <li>Critical Success The target is <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stupefied" target="_blank">stupefied</a> 2 for 1 round.</li>  <li>Success The target is stupefied 1 for 1 round.</li>  <li>Failure The target is unaffected.</li></ul></div>
