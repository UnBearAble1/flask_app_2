<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6 </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Swelling like a bubble about to burst, this oozing thing looks like it is made entirely from blood. Its slick, crimson skin is marred only by spots that look like clots formed on the surface.</div><div><br /></div><div>Created through the foulest of alchemical rituals, the blood ooze seeks only one thing: to increase its mass by consuming blood from the living. The blood ooze hides within the body of its victims, only bursting out to attack when another meal draws near, leaving the body a husk of its former self.</div><div><br /></div><div>The process by which such an ooze is created involves draining the blood of at least four Medium creatures and feeding all of the collected blood to a fifth creature, along with deadly reagents designed to prevent the blood from coagulating. During this time, the host slowly dies while the blood ooze takes form, emerging 2 to 6 hours later. Blood oozes have no loyalty toward those who created them, but some creators have noted that newly formed blood oozes seem to avoid harming other members of the host creature’s family.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is not widely known that an existing blood ooze can reproduce by splitting itself in half. It undergoes this division only if it has grown so large that splitting in half would create a pair of normal-sized blood oozes, such as the one listed below.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Ooze (Occultism)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Large, Mindless, Ooze, Lurker </strong></div><div>Perception +4; motion sense 60 feet, no vision</div><div>Skills Athletics +11, Stealth +0 (+12 if hiding inside a dead body)</div><div>Str +5, Dex -4, Con +5, Int -5, Wis +0, Cha -5</div><div><strong>AC 19 ; Fort +7 , Ref +11 , Will +9</strong></div><div><strong>HP 70; Immunities critical hits, mental, precision, unconscious, visual</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 10 feet, climb 10 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>: </div><ul>
