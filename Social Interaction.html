The agreement can be anything, but all participants must be perfectly aware of the full ramifications of the agreement and of sound mind when agreeing to it, or the effect fails. The consequences of breaking the agreement can likewise be any effects listed under special attack, including death, and allow no defenses. The consequences may only affect the participant, and cannot be utilized for tactical advantages outside of the intention of the agreement. Each participant can have different consequences, and some participants can even have no consequences (indeed, have no stipulations at all), as long as every participant agrees upon the rules and consequences.</div><div> </div><div>If any participant knowingly and willingly makes any attempt to cheat at or avoid fulfilling the terms of the agreement, the effect automatically determines them in violation and resolves accordingly. The effect doesn't function if any participant is acting against their will or being mentally controlled or coerced by any means, and at the GM's discretion, if it ever becomes permanently impossible for the agreement’s outcome to be determined, the effect ends without any further result. </div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Charm </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><strong><br />
Activation: Duration </strong></div><div><strong>Linked: Diplomacy </strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch </strong></div><div><strong>[Mental]</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You improve a creature’s disposition toward you. For the duration, treat this new disposition as their natural disposition to you, meaning you or your allies can still lower it again through your actions. This ability always allows for a willpower defense. </div><ul>
  <li>You improve a creature’s disposition by 1 (Tier C, 30 points) </li>  <li>You improve a creature’s disposition by 2 (Tier B, 60 points) </li>  <li>You make a creature friendly to you (Tier B, 120 points) </li>  <li>You make a creature helpful to you (Tier A, 200 points) </li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Force Long Term Social Behavior </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br />
<strong>Activation: Duration </strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch </strong></div><div><strong>Default Duration: One Week </strong></div><div> </div><div>You are able to enchant a creature into changing its behavior or opinion to accomplish a long term goal. This isn’t so much a direct controlling effect (for that, give it the controlled condition using Special Attack) nor a short term immediate forced action (for that, use the special attack option: Force Behavior.) This is for long term social manipulation. This always gets a willpower defense. </div><ul>
  <li>Trivial Behavior Change:  Example: The target will complement people more regularly.  (Tier F, 15 points) </li>  <li>Minor Behavior Change:  Example: The target cannot speak unfavorably about the subject for 1 week. This doesn’t change the target’s opinion about the subject, but the target’s attempts to speak ill of the subject—whether in speech, writing, or other communication—always twist into compliments and praise instead. The target likely becomes aware of this effect quickly and can avoid speaking about the subject entirely if they choose. (Tier C, 20 points) </li>  <li>Major Behavior Change:  Example: the target genuinely holds a favorable opinion about the subject, with their attitude toward the creature (or creatures associated with the subject, such as the owner of a location or artists in a performance) other than yourself or your party becoming two degrees better (for example, helpful instead of indifferent). (Tier B, 50 points) </li>  <li>Extreme Behavior Change:  Example: You shift the target’s alignment one degree along one axis.  (Tier A, 200 points). </li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Inflict Social Limitations</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Activation: Duration </strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch </strong><br />
</div><div>Similar to the Special Attack: Force Behavior effect, this effect forces social limitations on a creature, and is therefore not really designed to be used in combat. The creature always gets a willpower defense. </div><ul>
  <li>Target finds itself unable to speak any deliberate and intentional lies (Tier C, 20 points) </li>  <li>The target must directly answer your question. It doesn't have to answer truthfully (Tier C, 20 points) </li>  <li>Target is -2 to deception, diplomacy, sense motive, or intimidation (chosen at creation) (Tier C, 20 points) </li>  <li>Target is -4 to deception, diplomacy, sense motive, or intimidation (chosen at creation) (Tier B, 30 points) </li>  <li>The first time the creature meets another creature, the other creature reacts to them with a disposition 1 step worse than normal. (Tier C, 20 points) </li>  <li>The first time the creature meets another creature, the other creature reacts to them with a disposition 2 steps worse than normal. (Tier B, 40 points)<br />

If a body dies, the mind and spirit controlling it dies instantly. When the effect ends, the minds and souls snap back to their original bodies. At this time, if the original body is dead, the mind and soul attempting to return to that body die as well.  Swapping bodies may give you new abilities, skills and complications, as long as they were purely physical in nature. You could also lose access to certain skills, or take penalties to them, such as Might or Coordination, if the new body is not specialized in those.  <br />
