These are the sort of principles you are willing to fight to the death over, not just pay lip service to. You may often get forced into situations to your disadvantage if people take advantage of your code, but, to you, it’s worth it. There are no self control rolls here. You simply MUST obey your code of honor. The point value of your code varies on the type of code: </div><ul>
  <li>A simple, informal code that largely applies to people in your peer group worth -1 point. </li>  <li>If it is largely informal, but applies all the time, it is worth -2 points. </li>  <li>If it applies all the time, or requires suicide if it is broken, it is worth -3 points. </li></ul><div>You will have to work with your DM closely to come up with the code, but here are a few examples: </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Brigand’s Code of Honor:  [-1 pt] </strong></div><ul>
  <li>Always avenge an insult, no matter the danger</li>  <li>Your friends’ friends are your friends </li>  <li>Never attack a friend or member of your gang except in a fair, open duel </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Professional Code of Honor: [-1 pt] </strong></div><ul>

  <li>Never ignore an insult to yourself, the target of your affection, or your flag or liege-lord. These insults can be erased only with an apology or duel (though it doesn’t have to be the death.) </li>  <li>If the insult came from someone significantly low in social status, it may call for a whipping, not a duel. </li>  <li>Never cheat to win in combat, it must be equal (except in open war)</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Officer’s Code of Honor [-2 pts] </strong></div><ul>
  <li>Be tough but fair, lead from the front, and look out for your troops. </li>  <li>Be willing to fight and die for the honor of your unit, service and country. </li>  <li>Follow orders, obey the rules of war, and treat an honorable enemy with respect. </li>  <li>Wear the uniform with pride. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Chivalric Code of Honor [-3 pts] </strong></div><ul>
  <li>As gentlepersons, except: </li>  <li>Protect anyone weaker than yourself </li>  <li>Accept challenges to arms from anyone of greater or equal rank. </li>  <li>Even in open war, sides and weapons must be equal if the foe is also noble and chivalrous </li></ul><div><br /></div></div>
