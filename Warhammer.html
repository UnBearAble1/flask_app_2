<strong>Group</strong> Hammer; <strong>Traits</strong> Shove</div><div><br /></div><div>This weapon has a wooden shaft ending in a large, heavy metal head. The head of the hammer might be single-sided or double-sided, but it’s always capable of delivering powerful bludgeoning blows.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Shove:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div></div>
