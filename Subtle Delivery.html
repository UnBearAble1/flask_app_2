You can capably deliver toxins with a blowgun (and you use your Alchemist skill or your Warrior to attack.) Your <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/blowgun" target="_blank">blowgun</a> Strikes can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance. If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a blowgun loaded with a dart you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.</div></div>
