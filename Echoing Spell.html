You time the components of your spell with exacting precision, setting up a resonance that duplicates the spell's effects. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of Expert Tier or lower that has no duration, the spell's energy reverberates and echoes. You can cast the spell again before the end of next round, with advantage on the spell casting roll.</div></div>
