By putting composition to paper, you can create a source of stirring words or song that others can read and understand. You spend 10 minutes and the number of Focus Points it cost to cast the composition spell to transpose a composition spell on a special scroll that you or another creature can later activate. This composition spell must take a single action to cast. If the chosen composition spell requires a Performance check as part of the casting, the GM rolls this check as a secret check when you annotate your score. If you have <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/inspire-heroics" target="_blank">inspire heroics</a> or <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/lingering-composition" target="_blank">lingering composition</a> and the chosen composition spell allows, you can also use one of those spells to modify the annotated composition, with the GM rolling the secret Performance check. If you do, you spend an additional Focus Point, even if the secret check fails.<br />
<br />
Any creature that can read the language you used when annotating your composition can Activate the Item by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This produces the effects of the composition as though the activating creature had Cast the Spell.<br />
<br />
A composition you create this way loses its power the next time you make your daily preparations. While the composition is in your possession, you can render it inert using a single action that has the concentrate trait. You can't regain the Focus Points you spent to create the annotated composition until it is activated or loses its magic.</div></div>
