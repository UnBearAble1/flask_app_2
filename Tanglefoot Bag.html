On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/immobilized" target="_blank">immobilized</a> for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to Fly again for 1 round.
