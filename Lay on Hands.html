Your hands become infused with positive energy, healing a living creature or damaging an undead creature with a touch.

Against an undead target, you deal 20 damage and it must attempt a basic Fortitude save; if it fails, it also takes a –2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Special</strong>: If you are Master tier in Religion, you can cast this spell as a Master-Tier effect (increasing it's healing to 30). If you are Legendary tier, you can cast this as a Legendary-Tier effect (increasing it's healing to 40), but it costs 3 Focus Points. If you use either of these options, you cannot use either again until you have completed 2d4 full rests. </div></div>
