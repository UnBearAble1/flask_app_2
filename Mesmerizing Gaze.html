When you meet someone's gaze, they are unable to look away. Choose one target creature. That creature must succeed at a Will save or be <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/fascinated" target="_blank">fascinated</a> until the end of your next turn. If the creature succeeds at its save or its fascination ends due to a hostile action, it becomes temporarily immune to your Mesmerizing Gaze for 1 day. When you select this feat, it gains either the arcane or occult trait; once you make this choice, you can't change it.</div></div>
