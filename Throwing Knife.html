<strong>Group</strong> Knife; <strong>Traits</strong> Agile, Finesse, Thrown 20 ft.</div><div><br /></div><div>This light knife is optimally balanced to be thrown accurately at a greater distance than a common dagger. While this comes at the cost of a significant cutting edge, the difference is worth it for throwing specialists.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Thrown 20 ft.:</strong></div><div>You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon’s Range entry.</div></div>
