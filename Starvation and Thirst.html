<div data-component-type="text"><div>Typically characters eat and drink enough to survive comfortably. When they can't, they're <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/fatigued" target="_blank">fatigued </a>until they do. Without water, after a number of days equal to a creature's Constitution modifier + 1, the creature takes 1d4 damage each hour that can't be healed until it quenches its thirst. After the same amount of time without food, it takes 1 damage each day that can't be healed until it eats.</div></div>
