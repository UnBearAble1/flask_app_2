During your daily preparations, you can gain the assistance of an allied  spellcaster to gain the temporary ability to cast one spell for the day. The spell can be up to Expert level. Your ally must be able to prepare and cast it, and the spell must have a Targets entry or an area. Your ally loses the ability to cast the spell for the day, and your spell DCs are based on your relevant skill, or the original caster's skill, which ever is lower.</div></div>
