Using this action is heavily dependent on GM support and arbitration. They set what is possible, how long it takes, the DC and required components. Typically your jury-rigging allows for one &quot;use&quot; of the item, which could vary in time. For example, jury-rigging a speaker system to emit a high frequency sonic pulse to disrupt the senses of echolocating dire bats may only function once, but jury rigging a HexDrive to increase it's speed for a three day trip may last all three days. </div><div><br /></div><div>Options: </div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Overclock</strong>: You push it beyond its normal maximum limits. Typically this is done to increase the speed, range, or area of an item. 
    <ul>
      <li>Critical Result: The maximum limit is increased by 50%. </li>      <li>Standard Result: The maximum limit is increased by 20%. </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Modify Function</strong>: You modify an aspect of what the item was intended to do, such as adding a new damage type, or changing the type of signal a communication device could send. 
    <ul>
      <li>Critical Result: </li>      <li>Standard Result: </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>One Last Use</strong>: You temporarily provide a broken or destroyed device the ability to function normally. 
    <ul>
      <li>Critical Result: The device functions, and maintains integrity enough to allow you a second roll to attempt using it again. </li>      <li>Standard Result: The device functions. </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Your roll is a secret check, and typically you don't know the result until you activate and use the item. </div><ul>
  <li>Failure: Your modification breaks the device, requiring you successfully <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/repair" target="_blank">Repair</a> it in order to use it again. </li>  <li>Critical Failure: Your modification destroys the device instead.  If the device was a consumable one, a critical failure could mean the device explodes or otherwise causes you damage while you are attempting to jury-rig it. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
