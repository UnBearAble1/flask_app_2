</strong>The fury of a wild predator fills you when you Rage, granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that revere vicious animals (such as apes or bears) give rise to barbarians with this instinct. You might also be at war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of your personality, or you might be a descendant of a werewolf or another were-creature.<br />
<br />
You gain a special unarmed attack: These attacks are in the brawling group. Your Rage action gains the morph, primal, and transmutation traits.</div><ul>

    <ul>

Anathema: Flagrantly disrespecting an animal of your chosen kind is anathema to your instinct, as is using weapons while raging. Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the instinct's abilities and any feats that list your instinct as a prerequisite until you spend 1 day of downtime re-centering yourself, though you keep all of your other barbarian abilities.<br />
