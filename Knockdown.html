You make an attack to knock a foe off balance, then follow up immediately with a sweep to topple them. Make a melee <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a>. If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an Athletics check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/trip" target="_blank">Trip</a> the creature you hit. If you’re wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you can ignore Trip’s requirement that you have a hand free. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+6 Points) Improved Knockdown [Requires Master in Warrior]</strong> You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. When you use Knockdown, instead of making a Strike followed by a Trip for a single action, you can attempt a single <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> for two actions. If you do and your Strike hits, you also apply the critical success effect of a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/trip" target="_blank">Trip</a>. If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the Strike, you can use the weapon’s damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical Trip.</div></div>
