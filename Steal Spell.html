When you use Legendary Thief to steal the impossible, you can steal a spell from a foe. The spell is lost from their memory, and they are unable to cast the spell for the rest of the day. You can Cast the Spell once within the next 1d4 rounds, using all of the rules they follow, including their bonuses, after which the fleeting magic fades.</div></div>
