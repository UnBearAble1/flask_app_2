<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>1 Point</strong></div><div><strong>Ancestral Relationships, Enemies / Allies</strong></div><div>When you arrive at a new settlement, you automatically find the nearest enclave for your ancestry by spending 1 day of downtime searching, provided one exists and its members aren't actively hiding from you. Once you've made contact, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/gather-information" target="_blank">Gather Information</a> and <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/earn-income" target="">Earn Income</a> in the settlement.<br />
<br />
Additionally,  you can immediately attempt a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/diplomacy-chr" target="_blank">Diplomacy</a> check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/make-an-impression" target="_blank">Make an Impression</a> on members of your ancestry rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result. If you have the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/glad-hand" target="_blank">Glad-Hand</a> feat, you don’t take the penalty on your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is of your ancestry. </div></div>
