<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 4</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Symbols of grace and purity, unicorns resemble proud and noble horses. They are typically pure white of coat, but they are best known for the single, delicate horn that extends from the center of their forehead. While unicorns often serve as protectors of unspoiled wilderness and sacred places, they are themselves highly sought after for their horns, which are said to possess potent magical properties. To many, the mere idea of hunting such a magnificent creature in the hopes of severing its horn is utterly reprehensible. Indeed, a de-horned unicorn is a sorry sight, and few such unicorns survive much longer in the wild.</div><div><br /></div><div>Unicorns are found almost exclusively in remote, unsullied areas of wilderness. Sometimes associated with good-aligned deities, other times associated with nature and the fey, unicorns are always known for their righteousness and nobility. They are wary, at best, of most humanoid creatures, due in large part for poachers’ tendency to hunt them for their horns, but unicorns are often rumored to have a weakness for those who are pure of both heart and spirit. Despite some tales, unicorns are equally likely to recognize purity in young men as in young women.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Beast (Arcana, Nature)</div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CG, Large, Beast, Fey, Soldier </strong></div><div>Perception +7; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet</div><div>Languages Common, Sylvan</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +7, Diplomacy +8, Stealth +7, Survival +8</div><div>Str +4, Dex +3, Con +3, Int +0, Wis +4, Cha +4</div><div><strong>AC 19 ; Fort +9 , Ref +7 , Will +5 (+2 vs. mental)</strong></div><div><strong>HP 58; Immunities poison</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 45 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>: </div><ul>
