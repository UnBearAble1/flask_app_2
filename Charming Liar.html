Your charm allows you to win over those you lie to. When you get a critical success using the <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/lie" target="_blank">Lie</a> action, the target’s attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you’d succeeded at using Diplomacy to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/make-an-impression" target="_blank">Make an Impression.</a> This works only once per conversation, and if you critically succeed against multiple targets using the same result, you choose one creature’s attitude to improve.
