<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>3 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Cultural Training; Combat Teamwork</strong></div><div><strong>Reaction; Usable once per day; Trigger An ally within 30 feet takes damage that would otherwise reduce them to 0 Hit Points and give them the dying condition.</strong><br />
You move adjacent to the ally, and reduce the damage the triggering ally would take by 11. You redirect this damage to yourself, but your immunities, weaknesses, resistances, and so on don't apply. You aren't subject to any conditions or other effects from whatever damaged your ally (such as poison from a venomous bite)—your ally is still subject to those effects even if you redirect all of the triggering damage to yourself. If the redirected damage prevents the ally from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, they remain conscious and don't gain the dying condition.</div></div>
