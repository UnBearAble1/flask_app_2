You can magically hurl your weapon at your foe. You gain the hand of the apprentice universalist spell. Universalist spells are a type of focus spell, much like school spells. You start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.<br />
<br />
<strong>Hand of the Apprentice; Attack, Evocation<br />
1 Action somatic; Range 500 feet; Targets 1 creature</strong><br />
You hurl a held melee weapon with which you are trained at the target, making a spell attack roll. On a success, you deal the weapon's damage as if you had hit with a melee Strike, but adding either your intelligence or charisma modifier to damage in addition to your Strength modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage, and you add the weapon's critical specialization effect. Regardless of the outcome, the weapon flies back to you and returns to your hand.</div></div>
