  <li><strong>Simple: [-1 pt] </strong> Your trademark is quick to leave and can't be used to trace your identity directly, but you absolutely have to leave it. You can't leave the scene until you do, even if your enemies are breaking down the door. </li>  <li><strong>Complex: [-2 pts]</strong>  As above, but leaving your Trademark measurably increases your chances of being caught – initial carving, notes, traceable clues, etc. Leaving this sort of Trademark takes at least a minute. Anyone searching the scene receives +2 on rolls to try and trace you. </li>  <li><strong>Elaborate: [-3 pts]</strong> As above, but it takes about 3 minutes to leave your mark and it is so elaborate that it almost guarantees you'll get caught. Investigators on your tail may get automatic clues without any rolls required. </li></ul><div>You can't have more than one trademark, and the trademark isn't a common type of action for adventuring. &quot;Capturing bad guys&quot; isn't a trademark, but carving your mark on their forehead and releasing them naked may be. </div></div>
