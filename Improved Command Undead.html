Undead creatures find it all but impossible to resist your commands. When you use Command Undead, if the undead succeeds at its save but doesn’t critically succeed, it is your <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/minion" target="_blank">minion</a> for 1 round. If the undead fails its save, it is your minion for 10 minutes. If it critically fails, it is your minion for 24 hours.</div></div>
