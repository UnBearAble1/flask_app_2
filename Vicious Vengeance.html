While your vengeance is painful for both you and your foe, none can doubt that your enemies suffer more. You gain a +3 circumstance bonus to the damage you deal from Destructive Vengeance. This only applies to the damage the enemy takes, not the damage to yourself or the extra damage you gain after using the reaction.</div></div>
