<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat 7</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles a mechanical centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back. Instead of hands, the zelekhut's arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities, the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active flight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse's most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut's quarry are as famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.</div><div><br /></div><div>Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn't shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the zelekhut's job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments and track down those who seek to flee their punishment.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Monitor (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LN, Large, Aeon, Inevitable, Monitor, Skirmisher</strong></div><div>Perception +11; darkvision, true seeing</div><div>Languages Celestial, Infernal, Utopian; Truespeech: A zelekhut can speak with and understand any creature with a language.</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +9, Athletics +12, Axis Lore +6, Diplomacy +7, Survival +12 (+14 when tracking)</div><div>Str +6, Dex +5, Con +4, Int +0, Wis +3, Cha +3</div><div><strong>AC 21 ; Fort +10 , Ref +12 , Will +8; +1 status to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 80; Immunities death effects, disease, emotion, poison, unconscious; Weaknesses chaotic 10</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 40 feet, fly 40 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reaction</strong>: </div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/attack-of-opportunity" target="_blank">Attack of Opportunity </a></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>: </div><ul>
