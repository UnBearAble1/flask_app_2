<strong>Group</strong> Spear; <strong>Traits</strong> Grapple, Reach, Uncommon</div><div><br /></div><div>This spear has a specialized hook just before the tip that can catch on the gills of large fish. Azarketis primarily use this to hunt sharks, but it can also be used to hook flesh or armor. This weapon is common on the Isle of Kortos and within azarketi settlements.<br />
</div><div><strong>Grapple:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reach:</strong></div><div>Natural attacks with this trait can be used to attack creatures up to the listed distance away instead of only adjacent creatures. Weapons with this trait are long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div></div>
