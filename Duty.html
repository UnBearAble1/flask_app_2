These typically require you to obey hazardous orders. A particularly arduous job might qualify as a Duty, but most ordinary jobs wouldn’t. A strong feeling of duty is not a Duty, either (but may qualify for the Sense of Duty complication). The Duty you already have toward Dependents is already covered by that complication, so you get no extra points for this. </div><div><br /></div><div>The DM May restrict some duties altogether if they disrupt the flow of the adventure. They may also make some mandatory or suggested- depending on the nature of the campaign. </div><div><br /></div><div>The point value of Duty is based on how regularly you get “Called to Service.” This is a Flat check the DM rolls at the beginning of a session. </div><ul>
  <li>Almost all the time (DC 5): [-3 pts] At this level, the GM may rule that you are always on duty.</li>  <li>Quite often (DC 9): [-2 pts] </li>  <li>Fairly often (DC 13): [-1 pt] </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>This cost assumes occasionally hazardous Duty imposed through normal social means. If your duty is more hazardous, apply the following: </div><ul>
  <li>Extremely Hazardous [-1 pt]: Your duty is almost always very dangerous, and disobeying orders is even more dangerous. </li>  <li>Involuntary [-1 pt]: Your duty is forced upon you by threats to yourself or those you care about, and extremely deadly if you don’t follow it. </li>  <li>Nonhazardous [+1 pt]: Your duty doesn’t require you to risk your life. </li></ul><div><br /></div></div>
