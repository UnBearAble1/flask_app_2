Reaction; Trigger An adjacent enemy begins to use a reaction; Prerequisites: Master in Warrior</strong><br />
Grabbing a sleeve, swiping with your weapon, or creating another obstruction, you reflexively foil an enemy’s response. If the triggering creature’s attack DC is equal to or lower than yours, you disrupt the triggering reaction. If it is higher, you must make an attack roll against its AC. On a success, you disrupt the reaction.</div></div>
