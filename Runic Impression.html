  <li>Corrosive: Acid sizzles across the surface of the weapon. When you hit with the weapon, add 1d6 acid damage to the damage dealt. In addition, on a critical hit, the target’s armor (if any) takes 3d6 acid damage (before applying Hardness); if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes this damage instead.</li>  <li>Flaming: This weapon is empowered by flickering flame. The weapon deals an additional 1d6 fire damage on a successful Strike, plus 1d10 persistent fire damage on a critical hit.</li>  <li>Frost: This weapon is empowered with freezing ice. It deals an additional 1d6 cold damage on a successful Strike. On a critical hit, the target is also slowed 1 until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Fortitude save.</li>  <li>ghost touch: The weapon can harm creatures without physical form. A ghost touch weapon is particularly effective against incorporeal creatures, which almost always have a specific vulnerability to ghost touch weapons. Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield ghost touch weapons (unlike most physical objects).</li>  <li>Returning: When you make a thrown Strike with this weapon, it flies back to your hand after the Strike is complete. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.</li>  <li>Shock: Electric arcs crisscross this weapon, dealing an extra 1d6 electricity damage on a hit. On a critical hit, electricity arcs out to deal an equal amount of electricity damage to up to two other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of the target.</li>  <li>Thundering: This weapon lets out a peal of thunder when it hits, dealing an extra 1d6 sonic damage on a successful Strike. On a critical hit, the target has to succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute (or 1 hour on a critical failure).</li></ul></div>
