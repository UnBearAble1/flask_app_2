Your battle instincts make you more aware of <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a> and <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/invisible" target="_blank">invisible</a> opponents. You don’t need to succeed at a flat check to target concealed creatures. You’re not <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> to creatures that are <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/hidden" target="_blank">hidden</a> from you (unless you’re flat-footed to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature. While you’re adjacent to an undetected creature who's ability to hide is your level of perception or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.</div></div>
