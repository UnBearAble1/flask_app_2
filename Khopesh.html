<strong>Group</strong> Sword; <strong>Traits</strong> Trip, Uncommon</div><div><br /></div><div>This curved sickle sword has a pointed tip, allowing it to be swung like a handaxe or thrust like a short sword. The tip of a khopesh is usually hooked so that it can be used to disarm an opponent’s shield or weapon.</div><h2>Traits</h2><div><strong>Trip:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div></div>
