<div data-component-type="text"><div>Snares are small annoyances and simple traps you can create using the Crafting skill if you have the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/snare-crafting" target="_blank">Snare Crafting</a> feat. Creating a snare requires a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/snare-kit" target="_blank">snare kit </a>and an amount of raw materials worth the amount listed in the snare’s Price entry. Unlike other items, found snares cannot be collected or sold in their complete form. Snares have the snare trait.</div><div><br /></div><div>A snare is built within a single 5-foot square. Once constructed, it can’t be moved without destroying (and often triggering) the snare.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Crafting Snares</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You must have the Snare Crafting feat to create snares. You can spend 1 minute to Craft a snare at its listed Price. If you want to Craft a snare at a discount, you must spend downtime as described in the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/craft" target="_blank">Craft</a> activity. Some snares have additional requirements beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these snares list their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Detecting Snares</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Creatures can detect snares as they would any trap or hazard, using the creator's Crafting DC as the snare's Stealth DC. As you become better at creating snares, your snares become harder to detect by those with lesser ability. If you are an expert in Crafting, only a creature that is trained in Perception can find your snares; if you are a master in Crafting, only a creature that is an expert in Perception can find your snares; and if you are legendary in Crafting, only a creature that is a master in Perception can find your snares.</div><div><br /></div><div>If your proficiency rank is expert or better in Crafting, only creatures actively searching can find your snares.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Triggering Snares</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Unless stated otherwise in a snare’s description, when a Small or larger creature enters a snare’s square, the snare’s effect occurs and then the snare is destroyed.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Disabling Snares</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Once a creature discovers a snare, it can disable it much like it can other physical traps, using the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/disable-device" target="_blank">Disable a Device</a> action of the Thievery skill and using the Crafting DC of the snare’s creator as the DC. As you become better at creating snares, your snares become harder to disable by those with lesser ability. If you are an expert in Crafting, only a creature that is trained in Thievery can disable them; if you are a master in Crafting, only a creature that is an expert in Thievery can disable them; and if you are legendary in Crafting, only a creature that is a master in Thievery can disable them.</div><div><br /></div><div>You can automatically disarm a snare that you personally Crafted without triggering it by spending an Interact action while adjacent to the snare.</div></div>
