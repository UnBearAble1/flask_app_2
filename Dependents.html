  <li><strong>Basically Constant: [x3]</strong> - the NPC is always around. No roll required. </li>  <li><strong>Almost All the Time: [x2]</strong> - the NPC is usually around, but has their own thing they regularly break off and do. Flat Check DC 6</li>  <li><strong>Fairly Often: [x1]</strong> - the NPC shows up regularly, but doesn’t live with you. Flat Check DC 10.</li>  <li><strong>Rarely: [x 1/2]</strong> - the NPC pops up now and again. Flat Check DC 15.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Importance to You: </strong></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Employer or acquaintance [x ½]:</strong> You feel a responsibility toward this person, but you may weigh risks to them in a rational fashion. </li>  <li><strong>Friend [x1]</strong>: You must always try to protect this person. You may only risk harm to them if something very important (such as the safety of many other people) is at stake. </li>  <li><strong>Loved one [x2]:</strong> The Dependent is a relative or a lover. You may not put anything before their safety! </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Note</strong>: It may seem like an advantage to have a fairly capable ally who is nearly always around. You may even feel great about supplementing skills you don’t have with a few on your ally. Bear in mind that the DM is obligated to use this Ally against you occasionally. They will end up getting you into trouble, stumbling into situations out of their control, or be used against you, and their protection cannot be simply guaranteed with a hand-wave or trick of circumstance. </div><div><br /></div></div>
