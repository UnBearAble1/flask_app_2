Your mercy transcends the bounds of life and death. When you use Mercy, you can cast lay on hands on a creature that died since your last turn to return it to life. The target returns to life with 1 hit point and becomes <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/wounded" target="_blank">wounded</a> 1. You can’t use Ultimate Mercy if the triggering effect was disintegrate or a death effect.</div></div>
