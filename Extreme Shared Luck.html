You can use Lucky when an ally within 30 feet fails a skill check or a saving throw to allow the ally to reroll the triggering check instead of you rerolling your own failed check. As usual, your ally must use the new result, even if it’s worse than their first roll. If you have <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/guiding-luck" target="_blank">Guiding Luck</a>, you can’t use Guiding Luck’s effect that applies to attack rolls and Perception checks to use Shared Luck to benefit an ally.</div></div>
