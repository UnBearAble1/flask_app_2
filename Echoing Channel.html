When you pull forth positive or negative energy, you also create a smaller pocket of that energy. If the next action you use is to cast a 2-action harm or heal to heal or damage a single creature, choose one additional creature adjacent to either you or the target. Target that creature with a 1-action version of the same spell (no spellcaster roll needed). This spell is the same level as the 2-action harm or heal you cast and doesn’t cost another spell slot.</div></div>
