Odd interactions in your bloodline provide you with unexpected spells. You can learn one spell in your list of spells known from a tradition other than the one that matches your bloodline. You cast that spell as a spell from your bloodline’s tradition. You can retrain this spell with a week's time to another spell from another tradition, but you must learn that spell from the world in the same fashion as someone from that tradition would.</div></div>
