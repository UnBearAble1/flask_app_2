1 Action; [Concentrate, Manipulate, Metamagic]; Prerequisites: Trained in Spellcaster; Expert in Performance</strong><br />
You subtly weave your spellcaster into your performance. If the next action you take is to Cast a Spell, attempt a <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/performance-chr" target="_blank">Performance</a> check against all observers’ Perception DCs. If your Performance check is successful against an observer’s Perception DC, that observer doesn’t notice that you are Casting a Spell, even though normally spells have sensory manifestations that would make spellcaster obvious to those around you, and verbal, somatic, and material components are extremely overt. You hide all of these as part of an ordinary performance. This hides only the spell’s spellcaster actions and manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see a ray streak out from you or see you vanish.</div></div>
