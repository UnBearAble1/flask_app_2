Your field of vision is much more narrow. With this limitation, creatures can be considered <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/flanking" target="_blank">flanking</a> you in more combinations than just in directly opposite squares around you. Creatures are also more likely to be <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/hidden" target="_blank">hidden</a> or <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/undetected" target="_blank">unnoticed</a> by you, as your field of vision is more limited. The value of this complication is based on how restricted your vision is: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>No Peripheral Vision: [-3 pts]</strong> Your arc of vision is a 120 degree wedge, with no side peripheral wedges. Creatures outside of this wedge are fully hidden to you. Creatures can flank you if they are one square off of from traditional flanking positions.  (See the first image below, A and B are both successfully flanking C, who has no peripheral vision) </li>  <li><strong>Tunnel Vision: [-6 pts]</strong> Your arc of vision is only a 60 degree wedge. Creatures can now flank you if they are on any two sides of you with one square available between them. (See the second image below, A and B are both successfully flanking C, who has Tunnel Vision) </li></ul></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Example of No Peripheral Vision flanking: </h2></div><div data-component-type="image"><div class="img-container" style="text-align:center"><img src="https://d2x3xhvgiqkx42.cloudfront.net/e30b616f-bbbe-4e89-9286-0a5cb8148962/7db5aa5d-c0f9-43cc-a082-399286ac6f70/2021/06/26/2e8d167a-56d7-4f10-bb8e-769dd5db1b10/4176766a-eea2-4267-aa16-e2e5717e1c2f.png" /></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Example of Tunnel Vision flanking: </h2></div><div data-component-type="image"><div class="img-container" style="text-align:center"><img src="https://d2x3xhvgiqkx42.cloudfront.net/e30b616f-bbbe-4e89-9286-0a5cb8148962/7db5aa5d-c0f9-43cc-a082-399286ac6f70/2021/06/26/cb157371-f217-4fba-844c-29328eceab78/ae32d7ab-7b16-48af-9fbd-a5398b1b8bbc.png" /></div></div>
