Water cradles your every step, allowing you to walk on its surface. <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stride" target="_blank">Stride </a>up to your Speed. During your movement, you can move across liquids that don't support your weight. If you end your movement on a surface that can't support you, you fall into the liquid at the end of your movement. You can increase the number of actions to 3 to Stride up to three times your Speed.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost: (+7 points) Mist Strider:</strong> <strong>Usable once per 10 minutes</strong><br />
You condense the moisture in the air, solidifying it so it can hold your weight. When you use Water Strider, you can walk on air. You can ascend and descend at a maximum of a 45-degree angle. You still fall at the end of your movement if you don't end on a surface that can support you, as normal for Water Strider.</div></div>
