<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>6 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Perception; Pursue a Lead</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: </strong><a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/pursue-a-lead" target="_blank"><strong>Pursue a Lead</strong></a><strong>; Master in Perception<br />
1 Action; Fortune; Requirements Your most recent action was to </strong><a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/feint" target="_blank"><strong>Feint</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/request" target="_blank"><strong>Request</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/demoralize" target="_blank"><strong>Demoralize</strong></a><strong>, and you failed but didn't critically fail.</strong><br />
After your attempt to influence someone goes poorly, you add another bit of information or ask a pointed question, possibly salvaging your previous attempt. Reroll the failed check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check is the subject of a lead you're pursuing, double your bonus from Pursue a Lead on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.<br />
<br />
You can also use this action if you failed, but didn't critically fail, at a check to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/lie" target="_blank">Lie</a>, <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/gather-information" target="_blank">Gather Information</a>, <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/make-an-impression" target="_blank">Make an Impression</a>, or <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/coerce" target="_blank">Coerce</a>. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.</div></div>
