You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/tumble-through" target="_blank">Tumble Through</a> the spaces of Medium or larger enemies, and the presence of an enemy doesn’t make the squares difficult terrain. Your movement ends only when you critically fail an Acrobatics check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/tumble-through" target="_blank">Tumble Through</a> an enemy’s space (or when you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space). You still trigger reactions on a failure to Tumble Through, but you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks that you trigger in this way.</div></div>
