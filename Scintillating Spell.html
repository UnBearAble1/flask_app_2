Your spells become a radiant display of light and color. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the darkness trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/dazzled" target="_blank">dazzled</a> for 1 round, and those who critically failed are instead <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/blinded" target="_blank">blinded</a> for 1 round.</div></div>
