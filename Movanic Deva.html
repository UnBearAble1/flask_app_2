<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 7 </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Movanic devas are stewards of the flow of good creatures' souls through the cycle of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies. These angels arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a specific connection with a creature's vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives, so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent as well, thus increasing the flow of goodness into the afterlife. They also spend time patrolling the Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy Plane, seeking to contain significant threats to life.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Celestial (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>NG, Medium, Angel, Celestial, Lurker</strong></div><div>Perception +11; darkvision</div><div>Languages Celestial, Draconic, Infernal; tongues</div><div>Skills Athletics +11, Diplomacy +12, Intimidation +12, Nature +12, Religion +9, Stealth +7, Survival +7</div><div>Str +6, Dex +4, Con +4, Int +4, Wis +5, Cha +5</div><div><strong>AC 20 ; Fort +8 , Ref +10, Will +12; +1 to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 80; Immunities negative; Weaknesses evil 10</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 30 feet, fly 40 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>: </div><div>Aura of Vitality (abjuration, aura, divine) 20 feet.
