Reaction; Trigger A creature attempts a skill check to perform an action that can be accomplished with one or two actions. </strong></div><div> After another has tried their best, you show everyone how it's really done. Attempt a check using the same skill that triggered this reaction. If you get the same type of result they did (critical failure, failure, success, or critical success) - improve your result by one step. For example, if they rolled a critical failure, and you also roll a critical failure, your critical failure becomes a failure instead. </div></div>
