The touch of undeath runs through your blood. Your family tree might contain powerful undead, like a vampire, or perhaps you died and returned a bit different. Add the following spells to your repertoire, even if they aren't normally part of the occult tradition (note you must still have the appropriate level of spellcaster proficiency to cast the spell):</div><ul>
  <li>cantrip: chill touch,</li>  <li>Trained: harm, false life,</li>  <li>Expert: bind undead, talking corpse,</li>  <li>Master: cloudkill, vampiric exsanguination,</li>  <li>Legendary: finger of death, horrid wilting,<br />
</li></ul><div>Blood Magic Necromantic energy flows through you or one target. Either you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spell’s tier x 2 for 1 round, or a target takes 2 negative damage per spell tier (if the spell already deals initial negative damage, combine this with the spell’s initial damage before determining weaknesses and resistances).</div></div>
