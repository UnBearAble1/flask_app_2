<div data-component-type="text"><div>An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell or effect  has the incapacitation trait, then creatures with defense rankings of a higher tier than the effect, or any creature with a Threat rating of 8 or higher, also treat their result as one one degree better. </div><div><br /></div><div>For example, <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/baleful-polymorph" target="_blank">Baleful Polymorph</a> is a Master tier spell with the incapacitation trait, and requires a fortitude saving throw to resist. Any creature with a Legendary fortitude save would treat their saving throw result as one degree better against this spell. Meanwhile, <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/blindness-6255307" target="_blank">Blindness </a>is an Expert tier spell that requires a fortitude save, so any creature with a Master or higher fortitude spell would treat their saving throw result as one degree better against the spell. </div><div><br /></div><div>Remember that any spellcaster can heighten any spell to a higher tier by casting it at that increased difficulty, which may allow them to overcome this trait's limitations. </div></div>
