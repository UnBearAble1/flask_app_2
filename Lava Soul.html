<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>6 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Physiology; Elemental</strong></div><div>Your elemental lineage manifests as magma and molten rock, and you can focus the magma into your hand to attack your foes. You gain a magma spike unarmed attack, which requires a free hand to use. This is an agile, finesse, unarmed attack in the brawling weapon group that deals 2d6 piercing damage, as well as 3 additional fire damage. Despite being an unarmed attack, this attack can be used as a prerequisite for feats that require you to be wielding a weapon in either or both hands. You also gain the critical specialization effect for this attack: the target takes 1d6 persistent fire damage (this replaces the normal brawling one.) </div></div>
