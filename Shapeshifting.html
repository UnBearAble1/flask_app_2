<div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Activation: Duration </strong></div><div><strong>Linked Skill: Deception</strong></div><div><strong>Default Action Type: Free Action</strong><br />
</div><div>This feat covers changing to an alternate form. By default, the action type you spend to activate the ability (which can be reduced or modified with limits or boosts) applies to both turning into the new shape, as well as turning back.<br />
</div><div>Unless your shapeshifting is extremely limited, or there are extenuating circumstances, this effect will allow you to be instantly unrecognizable. When interacting with creatures actively looking for something out of the ordinary, make a deception check. On a failure, they notice something suspicious about you. On a critical failure, they may realize you are shape changed. When interacting with creatures actively with reason to and attempting to identify the shape changed, you must make a deception check to avoid being recognized..<br />
</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Type of Change: </strong></div><ul>
  <li>Physical body <strong>or</strong> worn clothing / equipment (Mod -3) </li>  <li>Physical body <strong>and</strong> worn clothing / equipment (Default) <br />

    <ul>
      <li>If you are changing equipment and clothing, you can change it from one type to a similar other type - such as changing plate armor to leather armor, or a longsword to a katana. It gains all of the mechanical qualities of the new type, though it reverts back to normal if it leaves your possession when you used this ability.</li>      <li>If you are changing a creature: 
        <ul>
          <li>You can replace up to three of its skills with Athletics, Coordination, Might, or Stealth</li>          <li>You can replace up to 30 of its creation points (not including the cost of this ability) into other abilities related to the new shape. </li>          <li>You can add new complications </li>          <li>You can change its size to tiny, small, medium, or large. You can take the Large Size effect, replacing it's Base cost as a Mod cost. </li>          <li>Typically new feats and complications are physical only. </li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>If you are changing both your form and your equipment, you can opt to have some of the equipment 'disappear' into your new form if it is unable to support them, but you gain no benefit to them. </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Complete: Your shapechange is total. (Base: 16) 
    <ul>
      <li>If you are changing equipment and clothing, you can change it dramatically. For example you could change your armor to be royal robes, or your weapons to be rings, or even have your equipment disappear altogether as you shapeshift into a new form - but keep all the functionality. </li>      <li>If you are changing a creature, you may entirely change its aspects around, including its skills, complications and ability points to suit the new form. </li>      <li>Any size modifications you take have a Mod cost instead of a Base cost.  </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Special Restrictions: </strong></div><ul>
