The confluence has AC 19 and 90 Hit Points, +7 to saving throws, weakness 10 to area effects, and immunity to bleed and poison. Creatures can move through the confluence; creatures within the confluence are <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a>, and all creatures outside the confluence are concealed to creatures within it. When you Cast or Sustain this Spell, you choose up to two different types of elementals to act. You can also move the confluence </div><ul>
  <li>Air (air, electricity) The elemental looses a bolt of electricity from the confluence, dealing 3d12 electricity damage to creatures within 20 feet of the confluence, with a basic Reflex save. This doesn't affect creatures that are completely inside of the confluence.</li>  <li>Earth (earth) The confluence gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and resistance 10 to all physical damage (except adamantine) for 1 round.</li>  <li>Fire (fire) Flames roar through the confluence, dealing 2d6 persistent fire damage to those partially or entirely inside the confluence.</li>  <li>Water (attack, water) The elemental expels a powerful jet of water. Attempt a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet of the confluence, using your spell attack roll modifier. This attack ignores <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/concealed" target="_blank">concealment </a>granted by the confluence, and the elemental gets a +2 circumstance bonus on the spell attack roll against a target inside the confluence. The water deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit (doubled on a critical hit). This attack doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.</li></ul></div>
