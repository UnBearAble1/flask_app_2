You shroud yourself in obscuring elemental material. You become <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/concealed" target="_blank">concealed </a>for 5 rounds. You can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak, as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.</div><div><br /></div><div>Boost: (+1 point) When you use The Shroud, you can spend one additional action to disperse it as a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on you instead of as haze; the activity gains the concentrate trait. All creatures within the cloud become <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a>, and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Boost: (+2 points) You can use The Shroud one additional time per day</div></div>
