The magic flowing through your signifer’s mask allows you to see in the dark, and the mask dampens the distraction caused by sudden flashes of bright light. While wearing your signifer’s mask, you gain <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/senses" target="_blank">low light vision</a> - or darkvision if you already had low light vision. Additionally, if you are <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/dazzled" target="_blank">dazzled</a> while wearing your signifer’s mask and the target is <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/dazzled" target="_blank">concealed</a> only because you are dazzled, you reduce the flat check DC to target that creature from 5 to 3.</div></div>
