<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 8 </strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Kalavakuses work as slavers in the Abyss, earning them the alternate moniker of “slaver demons”; these fiends round up captured victims and sell them to other fiends or unscrupulous mortals. Pleas for freedom or clemency fall on deaf ears, as slaver demons consider anyone they can catch and hold to be their rightful property and theirs to sell. Kalavakuses know more than just physical means of restraining slaves; they also know how to fetter a victim’s soul. The most successful slaver demons have vast slave-pits in the Abyss where they keep stables of imprisoned souls.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fiend (Religion) </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CE, Medium, Demon, Fiend, Lurker</strong></div><div>Perception +12; darkvision</div><div>Languages Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic; telepathy 100 feet</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +5, Athletics +13, Intimidation +12, Religion +7, Stealth +9</div><div>Str +7, Dex +1, Con +5, Int +2, Wis +3, Cha +3</div><div><strong>AC 21 ; Fort +13 , Ref +9, Will +11; +1 status to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 80; Weaknesses cold iron 10, good 10, liberation vulnerability</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>: </div><div>Liberation Vulnerability The first time each round that a creature escapes from the slaver demon’s Enslave Soul or the slaver demon witnesses a creature being freed from captivity or mental enslavement, the demon takes 3d6 mental damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reactions</strong>: </div><ul>

The target can attempt to resist this enslavement with a DC 21 Will save. A slaver demon can have only one living soul enslaved with this ability at a time, and no more than one slaver demon can enslave the same soul. Enslaved: If a slaver demon kills a creature whose soul it has enslaved, the demon regains 20 HP and the soul is consigned to an eternity of toil in the Abyss, adding to the slaver demon’s tally of souls and allowing the demon to enslave another.

      <li>Success: The target avoids being enslaved and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</li>      <li>Failure: The target is enslaved and is enfeebled 2 for 24 hours or until the slaver demon is slain, whichever comes first.</li>      <li>Critical Failure: As failure, and the target also suffers the effects of a failed saving throw against dominate.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul></div>
