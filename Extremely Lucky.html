You can reroll the triggering check, but you must use the new result, even if it’s worse than your first roll. As with all fortune effects, this can only be applied to skill checks made that occur with an action that could be accomplished in under a minute. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+3 points)</strong> Guiding Luck: You can use Extremely Lucky twice per day: once in response to its normal trigger, and once when you fail a Perception check or attack roll instead of the normal trigger.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+2 points)</strong> Shared Luck: You can use Lucky when an ally within 30 feet fails a skill check or a saving throw to allow the ally to reroll the triggering check instead of you rerolling your own failed check. As usual, your ally must use the new result, even if it’s worse than their first roll. This benefit doesn't extend to the Guiding Luck boost above. <br />
</div><div><strong>Boost (+3 points) </strong>Group Luck: When you use Lucky, you can also give all allies within 15 feet who were making a saving throw against the same effect as you, or who were making a skill check for the same thing as you, a re-roll. </div></div>
