<div data-component-type="text"><div>With special gestures and utterances, a spellcaster can call forth mystic energies, warp the mind, protect themself against danger, or even create something from nothing. The fundamental building blocks of magic are the magical traditions and the schools of magic. The four traditions are arcane, divine, occult, and primal. A spell’s magical tradition can vary, because many spells can be cast using different traditions. A spell’s school, on the other hand, is intrinsic to the spell and establishes what the spell is capable of. Abjuration spells, for example, can raise protective wards, enchantment spells can change thoughts, and evocation spells can create blasts of fire. All spells, all magic items, and most other magical effects fall into one of the eight schools of magic. These schools broadly define what the magic is capable of. Every spell has the trait corresponding to its school. </div><div><br /></div><div>Regardless of their tradition, a spellcaster uses the &quot;Cast a Spell&quot; action (shown further down this article) in order to cast a spell. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions:</strong> Casting a Spell is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions depending on the spell, as listed in each spell's stat block. As soon as the spellcasting actions are complete, the spell effect occurs.</div><div><br /></div><div>Some spells are cast as a reaction or free action. In those cases, you Cast the Spell as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases will be noted in the spell's stat block—for example, “Reaction verbal.”</div><div><br /></div><div>Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. The Cast a Spell activity for these spells includes a mix of the listed spell components, but it's not necessary to break down which one you're providing at a given time. You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Spell Components:</strong> Each spell lists the spell components required to cast it after the action icons or text, such as “Three Actions material, somatic, verbal.&quot; The spell components, described in detail below, add traits and requirements to the Cast a Spell activity. If you can't provide the components, you fail to Cast the Spell.</div><ul>
  <li>Material (manipulate)</li>  <li>Somatic (manipulate)</li>  <li>Verbal (concentrate)</li>  <li>Focus (manipulate)</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Strain</strong>: Casting non-cantrip spells puts a lot of mental and physical strain on the caster, resulting in compounding penalties. As you gain strain, consult the chart below for how it impacts your character: </div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>You can remove 1 strain by spending 10 minutes meditating, communing with nature, praying, consulting your texts, or performing other non-combat actions specific to the nature of your magic.  Except unconscious, all conditions are removed as your level of strain is reduced. A full rest completely removes all Strain. </div><div><br /></div><div>If you are rendered unconscious due to strain, you will not rouse until you have completed a full rest, which begins immediately assuming you are able to rest (<a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/resting" target="_blank">as you can only rest once per 24 hour period</a>) otherwise it begins as soon as it is able to. </div><div><br /></div><div>As you accrue strain, consult the following chart. </div></div><div data-component-type="table"><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th data-column-width="147.328125"><div>Strain</div></th><th data-column-width="401.328125"><div>Penalty</div></th><th data-column-width="195.34375"><div>Conditions</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>Any 1 condition from the next column</div></td><td><div>Clumsy 1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>A second condition from the next column </div></td><td><div>Drained 1 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>A third condition from the next column </div></td><td><div>Stupefied 1 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>A fourth condition from the next column </div></td><td><div>Fatigued </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>All five conditions from the next column </div></td><td><div>Immobilized </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>Unconscious </div></td><td><div><br /></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div data-component-type="table"><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th><div>Spell of Tier</div></th><th><div>Strain Cost</div></th><th><div>Casting DC</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>Trained</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Expert</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>18</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Master</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>24</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Legendary </div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td><div>30</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Cast a Spell (actions: Varies) </strong></div><div>Usually, you can only cast a spell that is in your repertoire (your collection of known spells). The number of actions required are listed in the spell description. To do so, roll your Spellcasting Skill vs the DC in the table above (note, cantrips don't require rolls to cast.) </div><ul>
  <li>Critical Success: You cast the spell and gain 0 strain. Additionally, pick one of the following bonuses:

Additionally, you suffer a random Magical Miscast (see chart below) </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Save The Spell:</strong> If you fail (but not critically fail) a spellcasting roll to Cast a Spell, you can choose to try and save the spell. Doing so takes the same number of actions as the original spell, but if you lack the appropriate remaining actions this round you can continue casting into the following round. Once you've used the appropriate number of actions, roll Cast a Spell again, this time with a +4 to the roll, but treat failures as Critical Failures. </div><div><br /></div><div>If you have to continue casting from one round to the next,  you are unable to perform any other actions and are <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> and <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/fascinated" target="_blank">fascinated</a> with the spellcasting.

Cast the spell as per normal (using its new DC), taking the appropriate amount of Strain, but treat your result as one category worse than normal. If you naturally critically fail this check, roll twice on the miscast table. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Magical Miscasts:</strong> If you critically fail when Casting a Spell (even when attempting to Save the Spell), in addition to the double accumulating strain, you also suffer a magical miscast.
