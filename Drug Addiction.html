The cost of this complication varies on the following: </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Cost</strong>: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Cheap</strong>: [0 pts] A single dose is less than a gold, or easily acquired in the wild. </li>  <li><strong>Expensive</strong>: [-1 pt]  A single hit/dose costs 1 gp. </li>  <li><strong>Very Expensive</strong>: [-3 pts]  A single hit/dose costs 5 gp. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Effect</strong>: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Incapacitating</strong>: [-2 pts] renders you unconscious or otherwise completely useless for about 2 hours.</li>  <li><strong>Hallucinogenic</strong>: [-2 pts] renders you useless for work or combat, though you might be active and talkative. After 1 hour, make a DC 13 flat check each hour to end the hallucinations. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Addiction</strong>: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Highly Addictive:</strong> [-1 pt] Withdrawal checks are DC 13. </li>  <li><strong>Totally Addictive</strong>: [-2 pts] Withdrawal checks are DC 16. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Legality</strong>: </div><ul>
  <li><strong>Illegal</strong>: [-1 pt] This drug is illegal in civilized areas. </li></ul><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Withdrawal</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Use these rules when you try to give up an Addiction (whether it’s your choice or not). </div><div>This painful process requires a Withdrawal check every day, which is typically a DC 9 flat check. When you succeed on 14 of these checks, you successfully withdraw, and must immediately buy off your drug addiction complication or replace it with another complication of the same point value (work with your DM.) </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Physiological Dependency</strong>: If the drug gives you a physiological dependency, failure on your daily withdrawal check gives you two options. </div><ul>
  <li>If the drug is available, you can take a dose and restart the process from day one. </li>  <li>If the drug is not available, you take 3 points of damage and may continue the process (though this still counts as a failure on your road to getting 14 full successes in order to kick the addiction.) You cannot recover these hit points by any means until you either succeed or abandon the withdrawal attempt. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Psychological Dependency</strong>: As physiological, but instead of taking physical damage, you gain a 1-point psychological quirk each time you fail the check. These will continue to grow into progressively worse complications until you give in or until you get your 14 successes. </div><div><br /></div></div>
