You spend 1 minute making quick adjustments to someone’s clothing and appearance, causing their words to carry more weight with an audience of your choice. While speaking to that audience, the target gains a +1 item bonus to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/diplomacy-chr" target="_blank">Diplomacy</a> and <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/performance-chr" target="_blank">Performance</a> checks. If you have master proficiency in Crafting, the bonus increases to +2; if you have legendary proficiency in Crafting, the bonus increases to +3. This bonus lasts until this ability is used on the target again, the situation they were prepared for ends, or they next change their outfit.</div></div>
