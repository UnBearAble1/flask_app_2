With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stride" target="_blank">Stride</a> twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> against that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type. </div></div>
