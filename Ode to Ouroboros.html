You learn the ode to ouroboros composition spell, which enables you to temporarily spare your allies from death. Your focus pool increases by 1.<br />
<br />

Your ode temporarily staves off death. The target's <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/dying" target="_blank">dying</a> condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn't help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its dying condition, such as disintegrate and death effects.</div></div>
