Some believe they were created when two godlike brigands attempted to raid a celestial hall and had their bodies crushed together and thrown down from the heavens. Another legend states two asura twins once challenged a great warrior to duel them in turn. When they attacked him together, he was so enraged he slammed one into the other so hard that they were fused together from that day forth.</div><div><br /></div><div>Adhukaits are among the most elite asura warriors, making up for what they lack in spellcraft with sheer viciousness and single-minded pursuit of inflicting pain.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fiend (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LE, Medium, Asura, Fiend, Skirmisher </strong></div><div>Perception +11; darkvision</div><div>Languages Common, Infernal; telepathy 30 feet</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +12, Athletics +14, Intimidation +12, Performance +12, Stealth +12</div><div>Str +6, Dex +4, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4</div><div><strong>AC 21; all-around vision; Fort +10, Ref +12, Will +8</strong></div><div><strong>HP 70; Immunities:curses; Weaknesses: good 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 40 feet</strong></div><div><br />
