<strong>Group</strong> Axe; <strong>Traits</strong> Forceful, Sweep, Uncommon</div><div><br /></div><div>A common cutting tool, an adze resembles an axe—but the cutting edge is horizontal, rather than vertical. The adze's shape makes it popular among wood workers, and <a data-composite="true" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=110" target="">grippli</a> builders often use them to construct their treetop homes. The tool also serves as an effective weapon, due in part to the immense strength required to swing it.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Forceful:</strong></div><div>This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a +2 circumstance bonus to damage, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance +4 bonus to damage </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Sweep:</strong></div><div>This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.</div></div>
