Devils are evil with a silver tongue, and one of your ancestors dallied in darkness or made an infernal pact.. Add the following spells to your repertoire, even if they aren't normally part of the divine tradition(note you must still have the appropriate level of spellcaster proficiency to cast the spell):<br />
</div><ul>
  <li>cantrip: produce flame</li>  <li>Trained: charm and flaming sphere,</li>  <li>Expert: enthrall and suggestion,</li>  <li>Master: crushing despair and true seeing,</li>  <li>Legendary: divine decree and divine aura,<br />
</li></ul><div>Whenever you cast a spell from the list of spells above, gain the following Blood Magic ability: Hellfire scorches a target or fills your tongue with lies. Either a target takes 2 fire damage per spell tier (if the spell already deals initial fire damage, combine this with the spell’s initial damage before determining weaknesses and resistances), or you gain a +1 status bonus to Deception checks for 1 round.</div></div>
