You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object with 1 minute per Bulk. The filth falls to the ground near the object. </li>  <li><strong>Soil</strong>:  Lift trace amounts of filth from the ground beneath or adjacent to an object to soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object with 1 minute per Bulk. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions.
