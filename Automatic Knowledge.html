You know basic facts off the top of your head. Choose a skill you’re an expert in that has the <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a> action.  You can use the Recall Knowledge action with that skill as a free action once per round. If you do, you must take 10 (instead of rolling), only adding your raw proficiency bonus with no other modifiers (including attribute bonuses.) </div><div><br />
Special: You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different skill each time. You can use Automatic Knowledge with any skills you have chosen, but you can still use Automatic Knowledge only once per round.</div></div>
