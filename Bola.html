<strong>Group</strong> Sling; <strong>Traits</strong> Nonlethal, Ranged Trip, Thrown</div><div><br /></div><div>This throwing weapon consists of weights tied to the end of long cords, which can be used to bludgeon foes or entangle their legs.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Nonlethal:</strong></div><div>An effect with this trait is not inherently deadly. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Ranged Trip:</strong></div><div>This weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn't deal any damage when used to Trip. This trait usually appears only on a thrown weapon.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Thrown:</strong></div><div>You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon’s Range entry.</div></div>
