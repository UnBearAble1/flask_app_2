1 Action; Open, Stance; Requires: You are wielding a ranged weapon; Prerequisites Expert in Warrior</strong><br />
You take aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly. When using a ranged volley weapon while you are in this stance, you don’t take the penalty to your attack rolls from the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/volley" target="_blank">volley</a> trait. When using a ranged weapon that doesn’t have the volley trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage rolls on attacks against targets within the weapon’s first range increment.</div></div>
