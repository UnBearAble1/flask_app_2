</br><h1>Great Boaster</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>3 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Professional; Fortune</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: Charisma 14; </strong><a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//firebrand-braggart" target="_blank"><strong>Firebrand Braggart</strong></a><br /></br>Your bragging is particularly effective. If you succeed at a boast, you can attempt a great boast about that same skill by using your Firebrand Braggart action about the same action during the duration of your original boast's circumstance bonus; this is an exception to the rule that you can't make another boast about the same action until your next daily preparations. A great boast uses the Firebrand Braggart action, except that if you succeed, your circumstance bonus increases to +2 and remains for 1 hour. If you fail the great boast, you take a -2 circumstance penalty to attempt the same action for 4 hours. Once you declare a great boast about a particular action, you can't declare a great boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check. The minimum challenging task for a great boast is one with at least master DC.</div></div>
