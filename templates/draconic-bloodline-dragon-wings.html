You also increase your focus pool by 1.<br /></br><br /></br><strong>Dragon Wings; Morph,Transmutation<br /></br>2 Actions; somatic, verbal; Duration 1 minute</strong><br /></br>Leather Wings spout from your back. Each round this is in effect, you gain a fly speed equal to your speed but it ends at the end of the round and you begin to fall - gliding down 60 feet (you take no damage if you hit the ground.) When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as feather fall. You can increase the Focus Point cost by 1 to gain the effects of dragon claws as long as the wings last.<br /></br><br /></br>Additionally, immediately upon casting this spell, until the end of your next turn, Draconic scales grow briefly on you, granting a +1 status bonus to AC for 1 round.</div></div>
