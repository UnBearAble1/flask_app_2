You must shoot the ammunition before the end of your turn or the magic dissipates. The DC is your tradition skill DC (occultism, arcane, nature, or religion) or spellcasting DC. <br /></br><br /></br>Climbing Bolt: The shaft of this bolt is wrapped with fine twine. When the bolt strikes a solid surface, the twine unwinds and enlarges into a 50-foot-long rope, securely fastened to the surface the bolt struck. The rope can be pulled free with an Interact action and a successful DC Athletics check. (This arrow lasts for 10 minutes before dissolving, and only one can exist at a time.)<br /></br></div></div>
