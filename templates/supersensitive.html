This doesn't give you any useful sort of telepathy, but you do hear a sort of psychic &quot;mumbling&quot; that grows more intense the more people around you. If there is even one sapient being within 50 feet of you, you are <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/clumsy" target="_blank">clumsy</a> 1 and <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/stupefied" target="_blank">stupefied</a> 1. These each increase to 2 if there are 10 or more people, or 3 for 100 or more, or 4 for more than a thousand.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>The advantage to this, however, is it counts as an imprecise sense for detecting sapient life - even through walls and other barriers!</br></div></div>
