If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or unarmed attack gains the effects of the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//ghost-touch" target="_blank">ghost touch</a> property, which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.<br /></br><br /></br>Anethema: Disrespecting corpses or spirits is anathema to your instinct; defending yourself against undead creatures is not. Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the instinct's abilities and any feats that list your instinct as a prerequisite until you spend 1 day of downtime re-centering yourself, though you keep all of your other barbarian abilities.<br /></br><br /></br>Raging Resistance: You resist your Con Modifier in piercing and negative damage, as well as damage dealt by the attacks and abilities of undead creatures, regardless of the damage type.</div><div><br /></div><div>Special: You can only benefit from one Instinct type per rage</div></div>
