You either make a melee <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> against the triggering foe or attempt to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//disarm" target="_blank">Disarm</a> it of the weapon it used for the Strike.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+3 Points) Felicitous Riposte [Requires Master in Warrior] </strong>You take advantage of your foe's openings with uncanny odds. When you make an Opportune Riposte, roll twice on the attack roll and take the better result.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+6 Points) Reflexive Riposte [Requires Master in Warrior]</strong> You can riposte almost without a thought. At the start of each of your turns when you regain your actions, you gain an additional reaction that can be used only to perform an Opportune Riposte.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+5 Points) Impossible Riposte [Requires Master in Warrior]:</strong> You can use Opportune Riposte with a trigger of "A foe outside of your reach critically fails an attack roll against you" in addition to its usual trigger. When you use Opportune Riposte with this new trigger against a ranged attack, your Strike deflects some of the triggering effect back toward its source. Compare the result of your attack roll to the AC of the triggering foe. On a hit, you deal the normal amount of damage for your Strike, but the damage type changes to that of the triggering attack. For instance, if you used Opportune Riposte to deflect a ray of frost, your Strike would deal cold damage instead of its normal damage type.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
