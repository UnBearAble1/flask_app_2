You can use that feat until your next daily preparations. You must meet all of the feat's other prerequisites.<br /></br><br /></br><strong>Boost (+3 Points) Ultimate Flexibility:</strong> you can adapt to the battlefield's challenges by spending 1 hour to train. If you do, you can reselect the feats chosen with combat flexibility as if you had made your daily preparations. You can't trade out limited-use abilities that you've already used.</br></div></div>
