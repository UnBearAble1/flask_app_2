There are two versions of this complication:</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>General</strong>: Once per play session the GM will purposefully and maliciously strike your character with bad luck. This could mean turning a roll into a critical failure, or allowing incredibly bad timing for events. If the plot calls for something bad to happen, it will probably be you. The DM cannot kill you outright with this bad luck.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Specific</strong>: You are unlucky in a specific way, such as &quot;You are always 5 minutes late&quot; or &quot;Your weapons always break.&quot; or &quot;Objects tend to fall on your head.&quot; The DM should do their best to make your Unluckiness work this way. However, this is a characterization tool and not a hard-and-fast game mechanic. Bad luck can always manifest in other ways if the GM wants to keep you on your toes!</div></div>
