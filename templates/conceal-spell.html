If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, attempt a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//stealth-dex" target="_blank">Stealth</a> check against one or more observers' Perception DCs; if the spell has verbal components, you must also attempt a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//deception-chr" target="_blank">Deception</a> check against the observers' Perception DC. If you succeed at your check (or checks) against an observer's DC, that observer doesn't notice you're casting a spell, even though material, somatic, and verbal components are usually noticeable and spells normally have sensory manifestations that would make spellcaster obvious to those nearby.<br /></br><br /></br>This ability hides only the spell's spellcaster actions and manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see a ray streak out from you or see you vanish into thin air.</div></div>
