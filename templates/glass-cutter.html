You can use the glass cutter's wheel to score ordinary glass and use the bulb to break the piece along your scoring. It typically takes 1 minute of work to cut a hole large enough to fit your hand. If you are attempting to break the glass quietly, you must attempt a</br>Thievery</br>check against the Perception DC of nearby creatures to go unnoticed.</div></div>
