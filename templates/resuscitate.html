If you succeed, the target returns to life with 1 Hit Point, no points in any pools or any other daily resources, and still with any long-term debilitations of the old body.

It also has the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//wounded" target="_blank">wounded </a>condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.</div></div>
