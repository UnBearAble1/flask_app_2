For 24 hours after learning a prominent fact--such as the name of an NPC you have met, the details of your mission briefing, and similar information--you can recall it without attempting a check, though this doesn't allow you to automatically memorize long strings of numbers or text. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to remember a detail that has come up before in the current adventure, even if it was more than 24 hours ago. If you have the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//thorough-reports" target="_blank">Thorough Reports</a> feat and have expert proficiency in the skill you're using to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a>, your circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures from that feat increases to +4.</div></div>
