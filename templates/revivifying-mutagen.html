This uses a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. Once the action is complete, you regain 2d6 HP for each tier of the mutagen's power, and the healing tier is equal to one tier lower than the mutagen. The mutagen's duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of Persistent Mutagen.</div></div>
