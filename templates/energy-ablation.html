If your next action is to Cast a Spell that deals energy damage, whether or not it successfully deals damage, you gain resistance to that type of energy equal to the spell's tier x 2 (minimum 1) until the end of your next turn. If the spell deals more than one type of energy damage, choose one and gain resistance to that type.</div></div>
