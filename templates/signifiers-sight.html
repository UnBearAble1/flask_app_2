While wearing your signifer's mask, you gain <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//senses" target="_blank">low light vision</a> - or darkvision if you already had low light vision. Additionally, if you are <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//dazzled" target="_blank">dazzled</a> while wearing your signifer's mask and the target is <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//dazzled" target="_blank">concealed</a> only because you are dazzled, you reduce the flat check DC to target that creature from 5 to 3.</div></div>
