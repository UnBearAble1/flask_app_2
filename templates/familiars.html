</br><h1>Familiars</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Familiars are mystically bonded creatures tied to your magic. Most familiars were originally animals, though the ritual of becoming a familiar makes them something more. You can choose a Tiny animal you want as your familiar, such as a bat, cat, raven, or snake. Some familiars are different, usually described in the ability that granted you a familiar; for example, a leshy familiar is a Tiny plant instead of an animal, formed from a minor nature spirit.<br /></br><br /></br>Familiars have the</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/minion" target="_blank">minion</a> trait, so during an encounter, they gain 2 actions in a round if you spend an action to command them. If your familiar dies, you can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no cost. You can have only one familiar at a time.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Modifiers and AC</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Your familiar's save modifiers and AC are equal to yours before applying circumstance or status bonuses or penalties. Its Perception,</br>Acrobatics, and</br>Stealth</br>modifiers are equal to 6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier (Charisma if you don't have one, unless otherwise specified). It can't make Strikes, but it can use trained skill actions for skills for which it adds your spellcasting ability modifier. If it attempts an attack roll or other skill check, it uses 5 as its modifier. It doesn't have or use its own ability modifiers and can never benefit from item bonuses.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Hit Points</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Your familiar has 20 hit points</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Size</strong></br></div><div><br /></div><div>Your familiar is Tiny.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Senses</strong></br></div><div><br /></div><div>Your familiar has low-light vision and can gain additional senses from familiar abilities. It can communicate empathically with you as long as it's within 1 mile of you, sharing emotions. It doesn't understand or speak languages normally, but it can gain speech from a familiar ability.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Movement</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Your familiar has either a Speed of 25 feet or a swim Speed of 25 feet (choose one upon gaining the familiar). It can gain other movement types from familiar abilities.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Familiar and Master Abilities</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Each day, you channel your magic into two abilities, which can be either familiar or master abilities. If your familiar is an animal that naturally has one of these abilities (for instance, an owl has a fly Speed), you must select that ability. Your familiar can't be an animal that naturally has more familiar abilities than your daily maximum familiar abilities.</div><div><br /></div><div><em><strong>Familiar Abilities:</br></strong></em></div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Accompanist</strong>: Your familiar helps you perform. Whenever you attempt a Performance check, if your familiar is nearby and can act, it accompanies you with chirps, claps, or its own miniature instrument. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus, or +2 if you're a master in Performance.</li>  <li><strong>Ambassador</strong>: Your familiar knows how to act cute or focused on cue, helping you make a good impression. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/aid" target="_blank">Aid</a> you on a Diplomacy check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/make-an-impression" target="_blank">Make an Impression</a> (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction, which requires it to participate throughout the activity). It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question.</li>  <li><strong>Amphibious</strong>: It gains a swim Speed of 35 feet (or Speed of 35 feet if it already has a swim Speed).</li>  <li><strong>Burrower</strong>: It gains a burrow Speed of 5 feet, allowing it to dig Tiny holes.</li>  <li><strong>Climber</strong>: It gains a climb Speed of 35 feet.</li>  <li><strong>Damage Avoidance</strong>: Choose one type of save. It takes no damage when it rolls a success on that type of save; this doesn't prevent effects other than damage.</li>  <li><strong>Darkeater:</strong> Your familiar naturally recovers in the shadows. After spending 10 consecutive minutes in an area of dim light or darkness, your familiar recovers 1d10 hit points. You must be a master in either Occultism or Spellcaster (Occult) in order for your familiar to take this ability.</br></li>  <li><strong>Darkvision</strong>: </br>It gains darkvision.</li>  <li><strong>Fast Movement</strong>: Increase one of the familiar's Speeds by 10 feet.</br></li>  <li><strong>Flier</strong>: It gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.</li>  <li><strong>Focused Rejuvenation</strong>: When you Refocus, you generate magical energy that heals your familiar. Your familiar regains 5 hit points whenever you Refocus.</li>  <li><strong>Gills</strong>: Your familiar grows a set of gills, allowing it to breathe water in addition to air.</li>  <li><strong>Greater Resistance</strong>: Your familiar increases the resistance it gains from its resistance familiar ability to 10. Your familiar must have the resistance ability to select this.</li>  <li><strong>Independent</strong>: In an encounter, if you don't Command your familiar, it still gains 1 action each round. Typically, you still decide how it spends that action, but, the GM might determine that your familiar chooses its own tactics rather than performing your preferred action.</li>  <li><strong>Kinspeech</strong>: It can understand and speak with animals of the same species. To select this, your familiar must be an animal and it must have the speech ability.</br></li>  <li><strong>Lab Assistant</strong>: It can use your <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/quick-alchemy" target="_blank">Quick Alchemy</a> action. You must have Quick Alchemy, and your familiar must be in your space. This has the same cost and requirement as if you used it. It must have the manual dexterity ability to select this.</li>  <li><strong>Major Resistance</strong>: Your familiar's resistance increases to 20 to the elements selected for resistance. To select this, your familiar must have the greater resistance ability.</br></li>  <li><strong>Manual Dexterity</strong>: It can use up to two of its limbs as if they were hands to perform manipulate actions.</li>  <li><strong>Master's Form:</strong> Your familiar can change shape as a single action, transforming into a humanoid of your ancestry with the same age, gender, and build of its true form, though it always maintains a clearly unnatural remnant of its nature, such as a cat's eyes or a serpent's tongue. This form is always the same each time it uses this ability. This otherwise uses the effects of <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/humanoid-form" target="_blank">Humanoid Form</a>, except the change is purely cosmetic. It only appears humanoid and gains no new capabilities. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity and speech abilities to select this.</li>  <li><strong>Partner in Crime</strong>: Your familiar is your criminal associate. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/aid" target="_blank">Aid</a> you on a Deception or Thievery skill check (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question.</li>  <li><strong>Plant Form:</strong> Your plant familiar can change shape as a single action, transforming into a Tiny plant of a type roughly similar to the familiar's nature. This otherwise uses the effects of <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/tree-shape" target="_blank">tree shape</a>. You must be either master in Nature or Spellcaster (Primal) in order for your familiar to take this feature.</br></li>  <li><strong>Poison Reservoir</strong>: Your homunculus familiar has a reservoir for poison, allowing it to apply an injury poison to an adjacent ally's exposed weapon with a single Interact action. You must supply the poison and instill it into this reservoir using two consecutive Interact actions. You must have a homunculus familiar to select this ability.</li>  <li><strong>Resistance</strong>: Choose two of the following: acid, cold, electricity, fire, poison, or sonic. Your familiar gains resistance of 5 against these</br></li>  <li><strong>Scent</strong>: It gains <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/senses" target="_blank">scent</a> (imprecise, 30 feet).</li>  <li><strong>Second Opinion</strong>: Your familiar is your academic confidant. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/aid" target="_blank">Aid</a> you on a Recall Knowledge skill check for a skill in which it has the skilled familiar ability (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question. Your familiar must have the skilled ability to select this.</li>  <li><strong>Shadow Step:</strong> Your familiar gains the Shadow Step action. Your familiar must have the darkeater ability in order to take this one.</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Shadow Step</br></br>        <ul></br>          <li>Single Action (conjuration, shadow, teleportation)</br></li>          <li>Requirements The familiar is in dim light or darkness.</br></li>          <li>Effect The familiar teleports itself up to 30 feet. The destination must be in dim light or darkness and must be within your familiar's line of sight and line of effect. This action has the trait matching your tradition of magic, or occult if you aren't a spellcaster.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Skilled</strong>: Choose a skill other than Acrobatics or Stealth. Your familiar adds your spellcasting modifier (or charisma, if you don't have one) to this skill, and is considered trained. You can select this ability repeatedly, choosing a different skill each time.</li>  <li><strong>Snoop</strong>: Your familiar keeps its eyes and ears open, ready to relay every snippet of gossip it catches, helping you gather information. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/aid" target="_blank">Aid</a> you on a Diplomacy check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/gather-information" target="_blank">Gather Information</a> (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction, which requires it to participate throughout the activity). It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question.</li>  <li><strong>Speech</strong>: It understands and speaks a language you know.</li>  <li><strong>Spellcasting</strong>: Pick a trained-tier spell that you know. Your familiar can cast this spell using your total spellcaster skill. Each time after the first time it attempts to do this it takes -4 (cumulative) to the roll.</br></li>  <li><strong>Threat Display</strong>: Your familiar helps you convey wordless threats through body language. Whenever you attempt an Intimidation check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/demoralize" target="_blank">Demoralize</a> a creature, if your familiar is within 30 feet of your target and can act, it accompanies you with snarls, hisses, or raising its hackles. If it can do so, you don't take the normal -4 penalty on the Intimidation check if your target doesn't understand the language you're speaking.</li>  <li><strong>Toolbearer</strong>: Your familiar can carry a set of tools of up to light Bulk. So long as your familiar is adjacent to you, you can draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them as if you were wearing them. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity ability to select this.</li>  <li><strong>Touch Telepathy</strong>: Your familiar can telepathically communicate with you via touch. If it also has the speech ability, it can telepathically communicate via touch with any creature if they share a language.</li>  <li><strong>Tough</strong>: Your familiar has 40 hit points.</br></li>  <li><strong>Tremorsense</strong>: Your familiar is keenly aware of any vibrations traveling through a surface. It gains imprecise <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/senses" target="_blank">tremorsense</a> with a range of 30 feet.</li>  <li><strong>Valet</strong>: You can command your familiar to deliver you items more efficiently. Your familiar doesn't use its 2 actions immediately upon your command. Instead, up to twice before the end of your turn, you can have your familiar Interact to retrieve an item of light or negligible Bulk you are wearing and place it into one of your free hands. The familiar can't use this ability to retrieve stowed items. If the familiar has a different number of actions, it can retrieve one item for each action it has when commanded this way.</li>  <li><strong>Wavesense</strong>: Your familiar can sense vibrations in the water. It gains imprecise wavesense with a range of 30 feet.<br /></br></li></ul><div><strong>Master Abilities:</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Cantrip Connection</strong>: Designate a cantrip that you are able to cast, and to add to your repertoire every time you select this ability.</br></li>  <li><strong>Extra Reagents</strong>: You can make one additional expert alchemical item or two trained items with advanced alchemy.</br></li>  <li><strong>Familiar Focus</strong>: Once per day, your familiar can use 2 actions with the concentrate trait to restore 1 Focus Point to your focus pool, up to your usual maximum. You must have a focus pool to select this.</li>  <li><strong>Innate Surge</strong>: Once per day, you can draw upon your familiar's innate magic to replenish your own. You can cast one innate spell gained from an ancestry feat that you have already cast today. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.</li>  <li><strong>Lifelink</strong>: If your familiar would be reduced to 0 HP by damage, as a reaction with the concentrate trait, you can take the damage. If you do, you take all the damage and your familiar takes none. However, special effects that would occur due to that damage (such as snake venom) still apply to your familiar.</li>  <li><strong>Recall Familiar</strong>: You can summon your familiar to your side. Once per day, you can use a 3-action activity, which has the concentrate trait, to teleport your familiar to your space. Your familiar must be within 1 mile or the attempt to summon it fails. This is a conjuration and teleport effect.</li>  <li><strong>Restorative Familiar</strong>: Once per day, your familiar can use 2 actions with the concentrate trait to give up some of its animating energy and heal you. It must be in your space to do so. You restore a 5d8 hit points.</br>This is an Expert Tier effect. </br>You can concentrate on this ability using 1 of your own actions to increase the effect to master-tier. Doing so reduces the number of familiar abilities your familiar gets per day by 1 and prevents your familiar from using this ability again. Both of these penalties last until you've taken 2d4 full rests.</br></li>  <li><strong>Share Senses</strong>: Once every 10 minutes, you can use a single action with the concentrate trait to project your senses into your familiar. When you do, you lose all sensory information from your own body, but can sense through your familiar's body for up to 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect.</li>  <li><strong>Spell Battery</strong>: Once per day, you can re-roll a Spellcasting roll on a spell you cast two tiers below your maximum tier.</br></li>  <li><strong>Spell Delivery</strong>: If your familiar is in your space, you can cast a spell with a range of touch, transfer its power to your familiar, and command the familiar to deliver the spell. If you do, the familiar uses its 2 actions for the round to move to a target of your choice and touch that target. If it doesn't reach the target to touch it this turn, the spell has no effect.</li>  <li><strong>Tattoo Transformation</strong>: Your familiar can transform into a tattoo you carry on your flesh. When transformed into a tattoo, the familiar looks like a colorful and stylized version of itself and can't act except to turn back into a familiar. It isn't affected by area effects and must be targeted separately to affect it, which requires knowledge that it's a creature. This means you and your allies can heal or assist the familiar while most enemies stay unaware of its true nature. Creatures must attempt a DC 20 Perception check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/seek" target="_blank">Seek</a> to realize a tattoo is actually a familiar (which few foes will try). Your familiar can still communicate its feelings empathically. Transforming into a tattoo or back to familiar form is a 1-minute activity that has the concentrate trait.</li></ul></div>
