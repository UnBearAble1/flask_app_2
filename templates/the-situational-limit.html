</br><h1>The Situational Limit</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>This limit is going to be a cornerstone of most abilities, allowing some truly customizable limitations and giving many abilities a great deal of nuance and flavor. It also is one of those complex ones, requiring some work between the player and the GM to make sure the limit fits within the context of the game, and is in the right price category. <br /></br><br /></br>A situational limit is one that specifies under what conditions your ability can be used. If those conditions are not met, the ability can not be used. <br /></br><br /></br>There are three flavors of this limit: <em>Triggers</em>, often used for reactions, <em>Tactical Encounter Requirements</em>, often used for non-reaction or non-triggered-free action combat abilities, and <em>Exploration Requirements</em>, often used for everything else. If you wish to apply one of the three categories to an effect that otherwise should fall outside of its purview, you'll need to work with the GM -- the point reductions are balanced specifically for their intended purposes.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>When selecting limits, you'll want to pick one that makes sense. If you look at the examples, and don't take them within their intended context, some may be a little too easy. </br></div><div><br /></br>There are also two modifications to this limit you can explore:</br></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Resettable Situations </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>Some situational limits may be appropriate, but too restrictive. Many of us have played the Ranger in the world's most popular roleplaying game, only to find ourselves being unable to use half of our abilities most of the time because of restrictions on target or environment.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If you reduce the restriction an entire two categories (for example "Usually Easy Setup" to "Very Easy Setup") you can add the following modification: <em>"Each day, as part of your daily preparations, you can swap out the condition of this limit to a similar one."</br></em></div><div><br /></div><div>For example, if you have an ability that only works on Undead (typically Difficult Setup / Limited Effectiveness (-35%) [Tier A]), you could add the ability to swap out the type of creature for another type each day, but the point value reduces down to (Easy Setup / Slightly limited Effectiveness: (-15%))</br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Incredibly Situational </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>For every three Situation Limits of the same or greater value, you can increase the Base or Tier Mod of the lowest Situational Limit by +1.</br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Triggers.</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Triggers are designed for reactions or triggered-free actions.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>To make a setup a trigger for a reaction or a triggered free action, it must be "Instantaneous." This list has the most common types of these, though you could possibly use the Tactical Requirements list for these types of actions, but adding the language that your most recent action was to perform the action, or those setups that require actions on other creatures' parts, such as allies or the target, assume the action was performed since your last turn.</div><div><br /></div><div>No matter how rare the specifics are, if there is only one possible situation in which your effect would need to fire, that trigger can be no higher than &quot;Easy Setup.&quot; </br>For example, gaining sonic resistance against a single attack would obviously require you to be taking sonic damage for it to even matter - so even if &quot;Taking sonic damage&quot; is listed as &quot;Usually Easy&quot; - because it's the only reason to use the power, it is downgraded to &quot;easy Setup.&quot; <br /></br></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Trigger: Very Easy Setup (Limit -2) </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>These triggers are almost always going to happen organically, usually even each and every turn.</br><br /></br><br /></br>Examples:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Target takes damage</br></li>  <li>Target successfully hits one of your allies</br></li>  <li>Target successfully damages one of your allies</br></li>  <li>Target uses a move action</br></li>  <li>You perform an easy action, such as "Raise a Shield"</br></li>  <li>You perform a specific move action (stride, step, leap, etc)</br></li>  <li>You take physical damage (bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing)</br></li>  <li>An ally performs an easy action, such as "Raise a Shield"</br></li>  <li>An ally performs a specific move action (stride, step, leap, etc)</br></li>  <li>Initiative is rolled</br></li>  <li>The trigger is magical</br></li>  <li>The trigger is non-magical<br /></br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Trigger: Easy Setup (Limit -6) </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>These triggers may require a bit of positioning or effort to make happen, but nothing you can't accomplish with a single action.
