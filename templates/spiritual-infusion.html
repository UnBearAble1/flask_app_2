If your next action is to Cast a Spell, Your spell has the effects of a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//ghost-touch" target="_blank">ghost touch</a> property. It can target or affect a creature projecting its consciousness (such as via project image) or possessing another creature, even if its body is elsewhere, though you must know about the possession or projection and choose to do so. Your spells can affect creatures on the Ethereal Plane, though this doesn't grant you any particular ability to locate them.</div></div>
