</br><h1>Observed</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using Stealth to Hide, it can become <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//hidden" target="_blank">hidden</a> or <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//undetected" target="_blank">undetected</a> instead of observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When Seeking a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than observed.</div></div>
