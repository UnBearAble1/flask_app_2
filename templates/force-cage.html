The cage is a 20-foot cube made of bands of force, each a half inch thick and a half inch apart, that extend to the Ethereal Plane. Each creature in the area where you create the cage must attempt a Reflex save. If such a creature fails, it becomes trapped inside the cage. If it succeeds, it's pushed outside the cage into a space of its choice. If a creature in the area is too big to fit inside the prison, the spell automatically fails.</div><div><br /></div><div>The cage has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A creature capable of passing through the space between the bars (typically a Tiny creature) can leave; all others are confined within. Attacks with a weapon too large to fit between the bars can't pass through the cage, and the bars provide <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//cover" target="_blank">standard cover</a> even against attacks that can pass through the gaps. Spells and breath weapons can pass through the cage uninhibited.</div><div><br /></div><div>Force cage is immune to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//counteracting" target="_blank">counteracting</a> effects of master tier or lower, but it is automatically destroyed by a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//disintegrate" target="_blank">disintegrate</a> spell of any level, or by contact with a rod of cancellation or sphere of annihilation.</div></div>
