The shrill noise can be heard clearly up to 2 miles away but is most intense near the snare's trigger. The snare deals 4d6 sonic damage (DC 18 basic Fortitude save) to creatures within 10 feet; a creature that fails this save is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//deafened" target="_blank">deafened</a> for 1 round (1 hour on a critical failure). The triggering creature is deafened for 1 minute on a failure, or 1 hour on a critical failure.</div></div>
