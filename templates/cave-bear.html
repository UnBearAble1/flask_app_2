</br><h1>Cave Bear</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 5</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins, the cave bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in natural caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is fiercely territorial. Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its prey's soft flesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remote-dwelling people, while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants--stone giants in particular have an affinity for keeping trained cave bears as pets or guardians for their homes.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Animal (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Large, Animal, Brute</strong></div><div>Perception +7; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet</div><div>Skills Athletics +11, Survival +6</div><div>Str +6, Dex +1, Con +6, Int -4, Wis +1, Cha -1</div><div><strong>AC 18; Fort +10, Ref +6, Will +8</strong></div><div><strong>HP 85</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 35 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features:</br></strong></div><div>Mauler: The bear gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage rolls against creatures it has grabbed.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Jaws; Melee Single Action; </br>+8 [+3/-2] Damage 2d12+5 piercing</li>  <li>Claws; Melee Single Action; </br>+8 [+4/+0] (agile), Damage 2d10+5 slashing plus <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/grab-monster-ability" target="_blank">Grab</a></li>  <li>Rush; </br>Two Actions; </br>The cave bear <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/stride" target="_blank">Strides</a> and makes a Strike at the end of that movement.
