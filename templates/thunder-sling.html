A thunder sling uses darts as ammunition. It can also hurl blowgun darts as ammunition but deals 2d4 piercing damage instead of 2d6 when used this way.<br /></br></div><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is -4 instead of -5, and -8 instead of -10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Propulsive:</strong></div><div>You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone.</br></div></div>
