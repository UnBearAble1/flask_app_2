While in this stance, the only <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//strike" target="_blank">Strikes</a> you can make are those using longbows, shortbows, or bows with the monk trait. You can use <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//flurry-of-blows" target="_blank">Flurry of Blows</a> with these bows. You can use Ki Arts feats that normally require unarmed attacks with these bows when attacking within half the first range increment (normally 50 feet for a longbow and 30 feet for a shortbow), so long as the feat or ability doesn't require a single, specific Strike.</br></div></div>
