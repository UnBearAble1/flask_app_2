You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your 5 plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:</div><ul></br>  <li>You deal 2 additional damage with melee Strikes.

Doing so means you can only use the feat while raging, but reduces it's cost by 20% (round up)</div></div>
