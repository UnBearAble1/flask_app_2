Over the course of the minute following the ritual's end, the waters display a scene of one possible future involving the primary caster and as many secondary casters as feasible. This scene is usually, but not necessarily, set within the next few days. The future is unwritten, so the casters would be wise to not read guarantees into the cryptic nature of the visions shown in the water.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success: The scene gives hints as to at least one danger the casters are likely to face, as well as at least one method of effectively addressing the danger (showing the group examining an area of a wall containing a secret hatch to bypass a trap, for example).</li>  <li>Success: The scene gives a hint as to at least one danger the casters are likely to face, or some cryptic method to effectively address or bypass a danger (such as a scene of lurking trolls, or a scene of the casters lighting several torches and passing them out, but not both).</li>  <li>Failure: The scene consists of so many contradictory details that it's impossible to identify a single danger or effective course of action from them.</li>  <li>Critical Failure: The scene is wrong; it shows the casters facing a danger they're unlikely to come across, or encourages actions that hinder a likely upcoming encounter (such as encouraging chopping down several trees before meeting an arboreal or a dryad).</li></ul></div>
