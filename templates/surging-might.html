If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores 10 points of the target's resistance against all the following types of damage: chaotic, evil, good, lawful, negative, and positive. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the positive energy within a field of life. This doesn't cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.</div></div>
