You recover 4d6 Hit Points instantly and gain 10 temporary Hit Points for 1 minute. This is an expert-tier effect. You can concentrate on this ability using 1 additional action to increase the effect to master-tier (and increasing the healing to 6d6). Doing so prevents you from using this ability again until you've taken 2d4 full rests.</br></div></div>
