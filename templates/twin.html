</br><h1>Twin</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don't need to have the same enchantments.</div></div>
