</br><h1>Summoned</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can't summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//minion" target="_blank">minion</a></br>trait. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. Normally summoned creatures exist only to aid in combat, and if conjured for any other reason, will disappear back from whence they came.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Additionally, unlike normal minions, summoned creatures may &quot;borrow&quot; an action from the following round to perform any 3-round actions they have when they normally only have two actions. Doing so reduces their actions the following round to 1.<br /></br><br /></br>Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
