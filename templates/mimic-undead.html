You gain a +4 status bonus to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//impersonate" target="_blank">Impersonate</a> an undead but physically intact version of yourself and are only +0 instead of -4 if you're untrained. You don't gain these benefits to Impersonate any other sort of undead. Mindless undead usually don't have a reason to even attempt the Perception check to notice your Impersonation unless you interact with them in some way.</div></div>
