</br><h1>Alchemist</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>By taking levels in the Class Proficiency: Alchemist, your character unlocks the art of Alchemy Infusion. Alchemy Infusion is the practice of pulling together ingredients from the world, infusing them with some of your own magical essence, and creating short lived alchemical items much more quickly than using traditional crafting techniques. In order to do this, Infusion Alchemists carry with them a satchel of ingredients. This item is Bulk 5L, and they can constantly refill it as they adventure by pulling in natural ingredients, strange curios, or items with emotional residue that still hold enough power. </br>It is assumed that they can refill this satchel without needing to specify they are doing so.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If an Alchemical item you create using this skill requires a saving throw or attack roll, use your bonus in this skill, plus your intelligence modifier. For example, if you are a master Alchemist (+6) with a +3 intelligence, the DC to resist effects from a poison you make with Quick Alchemy would be 19.</br>You also add your intelligence to the Splash damage listed for bombs.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Creating Alchemical Infusions is done using either Advanced Alchemy, which is the ability to make a small set of alchemical items during their daily preparations, or using Quick Alchemy, which lets them immediately craft and use an alchemical item.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//advanced-alchemy" target="_blank"><strong>Advanced Alchemy </strong></a><strong></br></strong></div><div><strong>Exploration</strong></div><div>During your daily preparations, you gain a number of Advanced Alchemy Points equal to your total skill (including INT mod) with Alchemist (so if you were an expert Alchemist [+4] with an Int of +2, you'd have 6 Advanced Alchemy Points per day). You regain these points each Daily Preparations. </br>During your Daily Preparations, you can spend these points to craft Alchemical Items you have the formulas for. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again. The point cost for items is based on their tier:</br></div><div><br /></br>Trained: </br>1</br></div><div>Expert: 2</div><div>Master: 6</div><div>Legendary: (impossible to make with Advanced Alchemy)</div><div><br /></div><div>Note, you may want to save some of your Advanced Alchemy points as a safety net for Quick Alchemy.</div><div><br /></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//quick-alchemy" target="_blank"><strong>Quick Alchemy</strong></a></div><div><strong>1 action, manipulate</strong></div><div>Roll an Alchemist check with a DC based on which tier of item you are attempting to create (assuming you have the appropriate level to create it): </br></br>Trained: 20, </br>Expert: 24, </br>Master: 28, </br>Legendary: 32. </br></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success: you create two of the item, the second of which can be used within the hour. </br></li>  <li>Success, you create the item as expected, and it must be used by the end of your next turn. </br></li>  <li>Failure, you do not create the item, and take -2 to further quick alchemy checks to create the same item for the next hour (cumulative).</br>You can immediately spend the appropriate number of Advanced Alchemy points (assuming you have enough left) to create the item (though it still only lasts until the end of your next turn), but this doesn't remove the -2 penalty.</br></li>  <li>Critical failure: </br>you simply do not have the ingredients needed to create the item. Until you've had time to gather ingredients </br>you cannot attempt to create the item again.</br>The gathering components time is based on the tier of the item:</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Trained: 1 hour</br></li>      <li>Expert: 3 hours</br></li>      <li>Master: 6 hours</br></li>      <li>Legendary: 12 hours</br></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Other Alchemy Rules:</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Additive</strong>: When you use quick alchemy to create items with an additive, increase the DC to craft the item by the Additive number. You can typically only use additives in items when crafting with quick alchemy.</br></div><div><br /></div></div>
