You suggest a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.</li>  <li>Success The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.</li>  <li>Failure The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.</li>  <li>Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.</li></ul></div>
