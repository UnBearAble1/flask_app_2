</br><h1>Giant Instinct</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>6 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Warrior; Rage</strong></div><div><strong>Instinct-style; Prerequisites: </strong><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/rage" target="_blank"><strong>Rage</strong></a></div><div><strong>Limit: You can only have one instinct-style feat.</strong><br /></br>Your rage gives you the raw power and size of a giant. This doesn't necessarily mean you revere giants--you might scoff at them or even aspire to slay them! You could instead seem like a giant to other people due to your exceptional strength or larger-than-life emotions and ego.</div><div><br /></div><div>Titan Mauler: You can use a weapon built for a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally and when raging). If you're not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you. You gain access to this larger weapon, which can be of any weapon type otherwise available at character creation. It has the normal Price and Bulk for a weapon of its size. When wielding such a weapon in combat, increase your additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/clumsy" target="_blank">clumsy</a> 1 condition because of the weapon's unwieldy size. You can't remove this clumsy condition or ignore its penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.<br /></br><br /></br>Anethema: Failing to face a personal challenge of strength is anathema, and you lose the instinct's abilities and any feats that list your instinct as a prerequisite until you spend 1 day of downtime re-centering yourself, though you keep all of your other barbarian abilities.<br /></br><br /></br>Raging Resistance: You resist your con modifier in bludgeoning damage and your choice of cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when you gain raging resistance.</div><div><br /></div><div>Special: You can only benefit from one Instinct type per rage</div></div>
