The target takes 12d6 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save) as the new features erupt. This spell has no effect on a target with a mutable anatomy or no limbs, such as an ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly and fall away after 1 round.</div><div><br /></div><div>In addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds, creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target, must attempt Will saves, after which they are temporarily immune to this secondary effect of grisly growths for 1 hour. This additional effect is a mental and visual effect.</div><div><br /></div><div>Success The creature is unaffected.</div><div>Failure The creature is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//sickened" target="_blank">sickened </a>1.</div><div>Critical Failure The character is sickened 2.</div><div><br /></div><div>Heightened: The damage increases by 4d6, and sickened conditions increase by 1.</br></div></div>
