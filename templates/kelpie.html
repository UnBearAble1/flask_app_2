</br><h1>Kelpie</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 5</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Kelpies are malevolent amphibious fey shapechangers intent on luring mortals to their doom. These cruel predators lurk in and around areas of water, slightly preferring freshwater over saltwater. Kelpies lure or drag their prey underwater then drown and devour them, leaving behind only the victim's heart and liver-- the only parts of a meal kelpies find unpleasant. Kelpies are fond of magically disguising itself as fine steeds or attractive strangers to draw in victims, but its true appearance takes the form of a hideous equine with slimy, green flesh resembling aquatic plants.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>NE, Large, Amphibious, Fey, Lurker</br></strong></div><div>Perception +9; low-light vision</div><div>Languages Aquan, Common, Sylvan</div><div>Skills Athletics +10, Deception +9, Stealth +8</div><div>Str +5, Dex +2, Con +3, Int -1, Wis +3, Cha +4</div><div><strong>AC 18 ; Fort +6 , Ref +10 , Will +8</strong></div><div><strong>HP 60; Resistances fire 5; Weaknesses cold iron 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 35 feet, swim 35 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Jaws: Melee Single Action; +9 [+4/-1], Damage 2d8+5 bludgeoning plus <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//grab-monster-ability" target="_blank">Grab</a></li>  <li>Captivating Lure; Two Actions (concentrate, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal) The kelpie instills an overwhelming attraction to itself within the mind of a single creature within 60 feet. The target perceives the kelpie as a desirable person (if the kelpie is in humanoid form) or a valuable steed (if the kelpie is in equine form) and must attempt a DC 19 Will saving throw.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Captivating Lure for 24 hours.</li>      <li>Success The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 round and is then temporarily immune to Captivating Lure for 24 hours.</li>      <li>Failure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend each of its actions to move closer to the kelpie as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated creature is adjacent to the kelpie, it either attempts to mount the kelpie (if the kelpie is in equine form) or stays still and doesn't act. If the creature is attacked by the kelpie, or if it can't breathe water and enters an area of water, the creature is freed from captivation at the end of the kelpie's turn.</li>      <li>Critical Failure As failure, but the target doesn't consider water a danger and will enter an area of water even if it can't swim or breathe water. If it is attacked by the kelpie or starts to drown, it can attempt a new save at the start of its next turn, but it isn't freed automatically.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Change Shape; Single Action (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The kelpie can take on the appearance of any Medium or Large animal of an equine nature (such as a horse, hippocampus, or pony), or any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn't change its Speeds or its attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes.</li></ul></div>
