</br><h1>Light</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>The amount of light in an area can affect how well you see things. There are three levels of light: bright light, dim light, and darkness. The rules in this book assume that all creatures are in bright light unless otherwise noted. A source of light lists the radius in which it sheds bright light, and it sheds dim light to double that radius.</div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="bright-light" level="3">Bright Light</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>In bright light, such as sunlight, creatures and objects can be observed clearly by anyone with average vision or better.
