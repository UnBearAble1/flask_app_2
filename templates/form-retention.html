When you cast a polymorph spell you can cast the spell at one tier higher. This doesn't grant any of the normal benefits of heightening a spell, but increases the duration up to 10 minutes. For example, if you were casting <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//animal-form" target="_blank">animal form</a> in an expert level slot with Form Retention, you would get the benefits of a trained-tier animal form that lasts for up to 10 minutes. If the spell can be Dismissed, that doesn't change.</div></div>
