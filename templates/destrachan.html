</br><h1>Destrachan</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>This underground reptilian horror walks on two powerful hind legs. Its forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in its vicinity. This cruel monster's true weapon, however, is an amplified version of the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles, but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans understand at least one other language--usually Undercommon--and can often be reasoned with.</div><div><br /></div><div>An obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won't hesitate to make a meal of carrion it finds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking and subduing them, then devouring them alive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Aberration (Occultism)</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CE, Large, Aberration, Lurker</br></strong></div><div>Perception +12; echolocation 120 feet, no vision</div><ul></br>  <li>Echolocation A destrachan can use its hearing as a precise sense at the listed range.</li></ul><div>Languages Destrachan, Undercommon; can speak only Destrachan</div><div>Skills Athletics +12, Stealth +10, Survival +10</div><div>Str +6, Dex +3, Con +4, Int +3, Wis +6, Cha +3</div><div><strong>AC 19 ; Fort +7 , Ref +11 , Will +9; +4 status bonus to all saves vs. sonic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 70; Immunities blinded, visual; Resistances sonic 15</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Jaws: Melee Single Action; +10 (+5 / +0), Damage 2d8+6 piercing plus 1d8 sonic</li>  <li>Claw: Single Action; +10 (+6 / +2) (agile), Damage 2d8+6 slashing</li>  <li>Destructive Harmonics; Two Actions (auditory, evocation, occult, sonic) The destrachan emits a harsh sonic cry that deals 9d6 sonic damage (DC 20 basic Reflex save) in either a 60-foot cone or a 30-foot burst.

This discordant ululation resonates along the nerves and bones of living creatures in the area, manifesting as waves of incapacitating pain washing over the victims. Each living creature in the area must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. The destrachan can't use Painful Harmonics again for 1d4 rounds.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected.</li>      <li>Success The creature is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//sickened" target="_blank">sickened </a>1 for 1 round.</li>      <li>Failure The creature is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//deafened" target="_blank">deafened </a>for 3 rounds and stunned 2.</li>      <li>Critical Failure The creature is deafened for 1 minute and stunned 3.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Shattering Harmonics; Two Actions (evocation, occult, sonic) The destrachan focuses its harmonics against a single item within 60 feet that is made of crystal, metal, stone, or wood. The target object takes 7d8 sonic damage. If the item is attended, its bearer can attempt a DC 20 basic Reflex save for the item. The destrachan can't use Shattering Harmonics again for 1d4 rounds.</li></ul></div>
