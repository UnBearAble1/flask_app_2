</br><h1>Finest Trick</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>12 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Physiology; Shapechanging</strong></div><div><strong>2 Actions, (Divine / Polymorph / Transmutation)</br></strong></div><div>You can imitate a specific person's appearance (of any ancestry of the same size and kind as your base ancestry, typically a humanoid for most ancestries) if you consume a bit of their blood, a lock of their hair, or appropriate equivalents as part of the action. You still must know what the creature looks like, and you must be aware that the consumed portion comes from their body. This will give you a +3 to Impersonate rolls, but is otherwise treated as a full disguise. It lasts for one hour.</div></div>
