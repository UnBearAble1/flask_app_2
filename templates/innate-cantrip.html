It has a tradition of your choice. It uses a class proficiency modifier of your choice (warrior, professional, spellcaster, alchemist) as it's DC, spell attack, or spellpower in general -- but if you pick anything other than Spellcaster, it does one dice less damage. (This feat can be selected twice, each time giving you a different innate cantrip)</div></div>
