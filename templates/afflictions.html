</br><h1>Afflictions</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Diseases and poisons are types of afflictions, as are curses and radiation. An affliction can infect a creature for a long time, progressing through different and often increasingly debilitating stages. The tier of an affliction is the tier of the skill used by the monster, hazard, or item causing the affliction or, in the case of a spell, is listed in the affliction entry for that spell.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Affliction Example</strong></div><div>To see how a poison works, let's imagine a poison called &quot;Tergosian Brandy&quot;. The item notes that you can't reduce your sickened condition while affected by Tergosian Brandy, and has the following text for how the affliction works:</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Saving Throw DC 18 Fortitude; Onset 10 minutes; Maximum Duration 5 minutes; Stage 1 1d4 poison damage and sickened 1 (1 minute); Stage 2 1d6 poison damage and sickened 2 (1 minute); Stage 3 2d6 poison damage and sickened 3 (1 minute)</div><div><br /></div><div>For example, if you drank a glass of wine laced with Tergosian Brandy, you would attempt an initial Fortitude save against the listed DC of 18. If you fail, you advance to stage 1. Because of the onset time, nothing happens for 10 minutes, but once this time passes, you take 1d4 poison damage and become sickened 1. As noted, you're unable to reduce the sickened condition you gain from arsenic. The interval of stage 1 is 1 minute (as shown in parentheses), so you attempt a new save after 1 minute passes. If you succeed, you reduce the stage by 1, recovering from the poison. If you fail again, the stage increases by 1 to stage 2, and you take 1d6 poison damage and become sickened 2.</div><div><br /></div><div>If your initial save against the Tergosian Brandy was a critical failure, you would advance directly to stage 2. After the 10-minute onset time, you would take 1d6 poison damage and become sickened 2. Succeeding at your second save would reduce the stage by 1 to stage 1, and you'd take only 1d4 poison damage. Failing the second save would increase by 1 again to stage 3.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you reach stage 3 of the poison, either by failing while at stage 2 or critically failing while at stage 1, you'd take 2d6 poison damage and be sickened 3. If you failed or critically failed your saving throw while at stage 3, you would repeat the effects of stage 3.</div><div><br /></div><div>Since the poison has a maximum duration of 5 minutes, you recover from it once the 5 minutes pass, no matter which stage you're at.</div></div>
