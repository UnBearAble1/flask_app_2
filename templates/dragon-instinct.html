</br><h1>Dragon Instinct</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>6 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Warrior; Rage</strong></div><div><strong>Instinct-style; Prerequisites: </strong><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//rage" target="_blank"><strong>Rage</strong></a></div><div><strong>Limit: You can only have one instinct-style feat.</strong><br /></br>You summon the fury of a mighty dragon and manifest incredible abilities. Perhaps your culture reveres draconic majesty, or you gained your connection by drinking or bathing in dragon's blood or after watching a marauding wyrm burn your village. Select one of these elements: Acid, electricity, cold, poison or fire. Your &quot;dragon type&quot; is one that would have a breath weapon that matches that element.</div><div><br /></div><div>While raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 4 and change its damage type to match that of your dragon's breath weapon instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack. If you do this, your Rage action gains the arcane and evocation traits, as well as the trait matching the damage type.<br /></br><br /></br>Anathema: Letting a personal insult against you slide is anathema to your instinct. Choose whether your character respects or abhors your dragon type. If you respect it, defying such a dragon is anathema, and if you abhor it, failing to defeat such a dragon you come across is anathema. Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the instinct's abilities and any feats that list your instinct as a prerequisite until you spend 1 day of downtime re-centering yourself, though you keep all of your other barbarian abilities.<br /></br><br /></br>Raging Resistance: You resist your CON modifier in piercing damage and the damage type of your dragon's breath weapon.</div><div><br /></div><div>Special: You can only benefit from one Instinct type per rage</div></div>
