You <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//stride" target="_blank">Stride</a>. At any point along your movement, you leave an afterimage of yourself behind. Alternatively, you can stop moving and send your afterimage forward instead, up to the remainder of your Speed. A creature that spends actions to engage with your afterimage can attempt to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//disbelieving-illusions" target="_blank">disbelieve</a> it with a Will save. Once an enemy has disbelieved any of your afterimages, they are temporarily immune to all of your Vivacious Afterimages for 10 minutes. As long as a creature has not disbelieved the afterimage, the afterimage counts as a creature for flanking. The afterimage lasts until the beginning of your next turn or until you use Vivacious Afterimage again, whichever comes first.</div></div>
