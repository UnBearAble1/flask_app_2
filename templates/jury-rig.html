Using this action is heavily dependent on GM support and arbitration. They set what is possible, how long it takes, the DC and required components. Typically your jury-rigging allows for one &quot;use&quot; of the item, which could vary in time. For example, jury-rigging a speaker system to emit a high frequency sonic pulse to disrupt the senses of echolocating dire bats may only function once, but jury rigging a HexDrive to increase it's speed for a three day trip may last all three days.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Options:</br></div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Overclock</strong>: You push it beyond its normal maximum limits.
