The flowing energy forms a ray with a range of 60 feet from the creature you damaged. You can't target any of the creatures you damaged with your Spellstrike with the ray. Make a spell attack roll (Spellcaster) against the new target's AC, at the same multiple attack penalty as the Strike. On a hit, the target of the ray takes 4d4 of the same type of energy damage the spell deals (double damage on a critical hit) if you used a cantrip, or 2d8 damage per spell tier if you cast a full spell.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If the spell deals more than one type of energy damage, you choose only one for the ray. This ray has the attack trait, the school and tradition traits of the original spell, and the trait matching the damage type.</div></div>
