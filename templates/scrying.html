Scrying works like <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//clairvoyance" target="_blank">clairvoyance</a>, except that the image you receive is less precise, insufficient for teleport and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.</div><div><br /></div><div>The effect of scrying depends on the target's Will save.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week.
