</br><h1>Lurker in Light</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall, with insectile wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief in a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they've been seen to take particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness. With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light are benign and friendly.</div><div><br /></div><div>While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the First World, these creatures are often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading the Shadow Plane to bring light to those who dwell there-not to help, but to spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>NE, Small, Fey, Lurker</strong></div><div>Perception +10; low-light vision</div><div>Languages Aklo, Common, Sylvan</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +11, Nature +10, Occultism +6, Stealth +11, Survival +8</div><div>Str +0, Dex +5, Con +2, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +2</div><div><strong>AC 19 ; Fort +7 , Ref +11 , Will +9</strong></div><div><strong>HP 60; Immunities blinded; Weaknesses cold iron 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet, fly 25 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Sneak Attack: A lurker in light's Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> creatures.</li>  <li>Ritual Gate: Single Action (conjuration, primal) Requirements The lurker in light has reduced a living creature to 0 Hit Points on this turn or its previous turn and has a summon fey innate spell available; Effect The lurker in light casts summon fey with only a verbal component, using the act of slaughter to replace the normal material and somatic components for the spell.
