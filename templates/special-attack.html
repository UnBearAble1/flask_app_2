</br><h1>Special Attack</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></br>A special attack is an offensive ability typically used on a targeted creature or area of creatures, though occasionally used on an object or the environment.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>To build a special attack, you pick <strong>Effects</strong> below. Unlike with other effects, all of the Special Attack effects bundle together automatically, and you select the <strong>Perimeters</strong> (the number of attacks required, range, area, targets, etc) for the entire combined special attack all at once, instead of improving those things with boosts.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>By default, Special Attacks:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Take One Action</br></li>  <li>Are not Strikes, and are their own unique actions</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Multiple Attack Penalty</strong>: </br>The second time in a round that a creature makes an attack (of any kind) that will deal direct (not persistent) damage, they are -5 to the roll. Any times beyond the second time, they are -10 to the roll. Other attacks are not subject to the MAP.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Here are a few other rules an modifications you can consider:</div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Regarding Multiple Defense Types </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>As you build a special attack, it may require multiple types of defenses, such as Willpower AND Fortitude. You always make a single attack roll, but since creatures have varying values in their defenses, it is possible only some sections of your special attack will work. This is fine, only apply the parts that actually succeeded. Sometimes it makes sense to have one effect be a required hit in order for the others to even stand a chance (for example maybe you shoot a poison needle, and the needle attack must hit in order for the secondary effect which allows a fortitude defense to even apply.) In those cases, you will make multiple rolls.</br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Terminal Damage </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>An individual attack may only benefit from the two greatest increases to its regular damage currently affecting it. Each additional source of damage increases its damage only by +1.</br> This represents a sort of 'critical mass' for an attack, the point where the attack is simply either deadly or not.</br></br><br /></br></div><div>Example:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>You have a special attack called &quot;Power Attack&quot; that takes 2 actions and deals +1d10 damage in addition to your regular strike.</br></li>  <li>You then have a special attack called &quot;Kick Em While They're Down&quot; that 'adds to strike' when an enemy is prone, dealing an additional +2d6 damage.</br></li>  <li>Then a party member casts a spell on you called &quot;Lighting Weapons&quot; that adds +1d8 lightning damage to your strikes.</br></li>  <li>Instead of your longsword (1d8+10 normal damage) attack dealing 1d8+1d10+2d6+1d8+10 damage to the prone foe, you can only benefit from 2 of the three boosts fully.</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>You would probably pick the lowest damage boost you have, which is &quot;Lighting Weapons&quot; Instead of getting 1d8, now it only gets +1 damage.</br></li>      <li>In Total your strike's damage would be 1d8+10 (Base)+1d10 (Power Attack)+2d6 (Kick Em While They're Down) +1 (Lightning Weapons)</li>    </ul>  </li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Building Afflictions </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>You can also design an attack to be an Affliction. An affliction always requires either a Fortitude or Willpower attack, even for types of damage or conditions that specify other types of defenses. When designing an Affliction, you'll be purchasing three or four different attacks as a linked ability, each representing a different stage of the affliction. If you want your affliction to deal damage, use the persistent damage prices.</div><ul></br>  <li>Stage 1 Afflictions: Regular Value</li>  <li>Stage 2 Afflictions: </br>Mod -4</li>  <li>Stage 3 Afflictions: Mod -8</li>  <li>Stage 4 Afflictions: Mod -12</br></li></ul><div></br></div><div>Onset: The default onset is instantaneous. If the onset is different, reduce the overall cost of the attack:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>1 Round: Mod -2</li>  <li>1 Minute: Base -4</li>  <li>1 Hour+: </br>Base -12</li>  <li>1 Week+: Base -16</li></ul><div></br></div><div>Durations: The duration of each stage is determined by the duration selected for the condition. If no duration is applicable (because you only select damage, for example) then the duration is 1 round. Damage always only occurs once per stage regardless of the duration.</br> At the end of the duration of a stage, the target gets another defense to see if the affliction progresses or regresses as per normal affliction rules. By default, the maximum duration of an affliction can be no longer than 3 times the final stage.</div><div><br /></div><div>Remember that any time you deal damage a round, it counts toward your Multiple Attack Penalty. Afflictions are no exception to this.</br></div><div></br></div><div>Multiple Exposures: Each successful exposure of an affliction increases its stages by 1.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Sophie's Choices </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>If you want your target to have the option to pick their own poison, so to speak, you can pick this feature. Here you can design two different sets of effects. The Base of the combined effects is equal to the average of the two (so add them together and divide the sum total by two - round up.) Use the same formula to calculate the Mod. When you target a creature, it can pick which effect it is subject to.</br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Sweetening the Deal </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>You can apply positive effects to otherwise offensive abilities, giving the enemy some benefit as well as harmful effects. If the benefit you give them is actually beneficial almost all of the time, you can reduce the Base of the offensive ability by half the Base of the beneficial one (instead of paying at all for the beneficial one.)</br> If the beneficial effect only applies if the enemy defends against your attack, then the reduction is only one third the Base of the beneficial one, and if the beneficial effect only applies if the enemy critically defends against your attack, the reduction is one fifth of the cost.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Note that the spirit of this option is to give interesting though impact-lessening effects to your offensive abilities. An example would be a "suppressing fire" ability that penalizes your target's attacks while increasing their guard defense as they dive for cover. GMs should not allow abilities with these options that don't follow that spirit.</div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="effects" level="3">Effects </h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>There are many types of Effects, allowing you to have truly unique abilities. Each effect has its own rules and limitations, so make sure to read each carefully. You apply limits and boosts to each effect separately, making sure that the whole ability makes sense and that they don't contradict each other. Remember, the GM has final approval on all abilities.</br></div><div></br></div><div>The effects are assumed to trigger on a successful roll. If the effect requires a critical success, then reduce the base cost of the effect by half, and the Tier by one. If you want the effect to trigger on a failure (not possible to make this a critical failure) then double the base cost and increase the Tier value by one. These modifications are made before limits and boosts are applied.</br></div><div></br></div><div>Many attacks are actually "Linked Abilities" that have varying results based on the attack roll, such as doing half-damage on a failure, full damage on a success, and double damage on a critical success.<br /></br></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Accuracy </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>This effect adds accuracy to your Special Attack.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>This attack is +1 to Hit (Base: 8) </br></li>  <li>This attack is +2 to Hit (Base: 12)</br></li>  <li>This attack has Advantage (Base: 16)</br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Add Special Property </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>This effect adds a special property to your Special Attack.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>This attack has the Sweep trait (Mod: 1)</br></li>  <li>This attack has the Backswing trait (Mod: 1)</br></li>  <li>This attack has the Nonlethal trait (Mod: 2)</br></li>  <li>This attack has the ghost-touch trait (Mod: 4)</br></li>  <li>This attack has the magical trait, but only for overcoming resistances.
