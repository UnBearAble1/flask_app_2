</br><h1>Magic and Spellcasting</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>When designing a spellcaster, there are three core choices to make:</br></div><div><br /></div><div>1. Your base (see character creation) must be either Hybrid or Adept.</br></div><div>2. You must pick your tradition (Arcane, Divine, or Primal)</div><div>3. You must decide if you are a Prepared or Spontaneous caster</br></div><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="traditions-and-spheres" level="4">Traditions and Spheres</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Magic is the ability to manipulate the world by mastering certain supernatural spheres of influence:</br><br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Space</strong>: Distances and planes of existence</br></li>  <li><strong>Forces</strong>: Unseen energies, like time, the astral plane, magnetism, incorporeality, gravity,</br></li>  <li><strong>Magic</strong>: Magic itself, curses</br></li>  <li><strong>Energy</strong>: Heat, cold, electricity, wind.</br></li>  <li><strong>Material</strong>: Nonliving matter</br></li>  <li><strong>Fauna</strong>: Living creatures' bodies, healing, positive and negative energy</br></li>  <li><strong>Flora</strong>: Plants and vegetation</li>  <li><strong>Mind</strong>: Mind, alignment</br></li>  <li><strong>Spirit</strong>: The dead, souls, spirits, ghosts</br></br></br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Arcanists</strong> can pull magic from other planes of existence and shape it through temporary metaphysical conduits called "Spells," constructed with complex non-euclidean geometry. Some arcanists are born with an innate tie to the planes, possibly due to their bloodlines, and are capable of using magic without the construct of spells. Prepared casters are typically called Wizards, and spontaneous Sorcerers.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Ability Scope: All spheres except for Fauna and Spirit</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Divinists'</strong> divine spells, often called "Prayers,&quot; can alter the world according to the divine edicts of their faith, by calling upon deities, their servitors, or the residual divine power left like the fingerprints of gods. Some divinists don't channel divine power through specific prayers, and instead are able to manifest aspects of their holy portfolio into the world. Prepared casters are typically called Clerics, and spontaneous Conduits.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Ability Scope: All Spheres except for Space, Energy, or Forces (excepting narrow 'domains' based on their divine portfolio).</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Primalists</strong> have learned to invoke the spirits and energy of the natural world, willing it to behave according to their well-established primal spells, or spiritual "Invocations." Some primalists don't require invocation training, and are instead able to speak to spirits in any given location at any time. Prepared casters are typically called Druids, and spontaneous Shamans.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Ability Scope: All Spheres except for</br>Space, Mind, and Spirit.<br /></br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="casting-magic" level="4">Casting Magic</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Both prepared and Spontaneous magic users have basically the same system for casting magic: They make Casting Rolls, and depending upon the result of those rolls, accrue Strain which gives them penalties. The key difference between the two is that Prepared Casters know specific abilities, built with Creation Points, just like feats (though much cheaper) and they can only use magic to produce these specific rote effects. Spontaneous Casters can produce dynamic effects, custom making temporary abilities on the fly. Either way, both use this system:<br /></br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Magic Casting and Strain</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Casting Magic puts a lot of mental and physical strain on the caster. Each time you use one of your Prepared Magic feats, make a Casting Check (a D20 roll with a difficulty check based on the Tier of the spell), with varying results:</br><br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Critical Success</strong>: You cast the Magic and gain 0 strain. Additionally, pick one of the following bonuses:</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>The Magic is -2 to defend against</br></li>      <li>The Magic's duration or range is increased by 20%</br></li>      <li>Roll with advantage on one of the variable rolls included with the Magic.</br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Success</strong>: You cast the Magic and gain strain based on the tier of the spell (see table below)</br></li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong>: You fail to cast the Magic, and you have two options:</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>You take the strain cost, and don't cast the Magic.</br></li>      <li>You can attempt to &quot;Save the Spell&quot; as outlined below</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong>: You take double the strain cost, and do not cast the Magic. Additionally, you suffer a random Magical Miscast (Prepared and Spontaneous casters have two different tables for this result, see each section.)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>For each five points of strain you have, you take -1 Strain penalty to all perception, defense, and skill checks and -5 feet of movement. If your penalty gets up to -4, you fall unconscious. If you are rendered unconscious due to strain, you will not rouse until you have completed a full rest, which begins immediately assuming you are able to rest (as you can only rest once per 24 hour period) otherwise it begins as soon as it is able to.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If you would gain <strong>more </strong>than (not just equal to) enough strain to reach a -4 penalty on a success for casting a Magic Effect, you cannot attempt to cast that Magic.</div><div><br /></div><div>Note: Hybrid casters suffer a -1 Strain penalty and -5 feet of movement for every <strong>3</strong> points of strain they have.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Full casters can remove 1 strain by spending 10 minutes, and Hybrid casters 15 minutes, meditating, communing with nature, praying, consulting your texts, or performing other non-combat actions specific to the nature of your magic. A full rest completely removes all Strain.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="table"><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th data-column-width="236.328125"><div>Tier</div></th><th data-column-width="234.328125"><div>DC</div></th><th data-column-width="229.34375"><div>Strain</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>F</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1 (fail only)</br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>D</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>C</div></td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>B</div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>A</div></td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>S</div></td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Save the Spell</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>If you fail (but not critically fail) a roll to Cast Magic, you can choose to try and Save the Spell. Doing so takes the same number of actions as the original spell, but if you lack the appropriate remaining actions this round you can continue casting into the following round. Once you've used the appropriate number of actions, roll to Cast Magic again, this time with a +4 to the roll, but treat failures as Critical Failures.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If you have to continue casting from one round to the next,</br> you are unable to perform any other actions and are flat-footed and fascinated with the spellcasting. Further, if you take any damage while continuing the casting in this fashion, you must make a roll against the tier of the Magic or the Magic is disrupted.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Ritualizing the Casting</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Prepared and Spontaneous casters can add bonuses to Casting rolls by adding Enhanced Components, also known as "Ritualizing The Casting."</br><br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Extra Actions (encounter mode):</br> Double (+2);</br> Triple (+4)</br></li>  <li>Extra Time (Exploration mode): +2 if you cast for an hour</li>  <li>Extra Time (Exploration mode): +3 if for six hours</li>  <li>Extra Time (Exploration mode): +4 if for twenty four hours</br></li>  <li>Special Components (Story based): Provide up to +3 for unique components</br></li>  <li>Ritualized Location (Right place right time, see below): Provide up to +3</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Find Ritualized Location: </strong>In order find the right place / right time component of Ritualized casting above, you'll need to make a check to find the right ritualized location. This is done with the appropriate skill check for the tradition. </br>In relatively known areas, this is a simple 1 action Recall Knowledge check. In unknown areas, this may take longer time to research (typically up to 8 hours.) Regardless of how known the area is, after your first Recall Knowledge check, you must perform research to attempt a new roll.</br><br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success: You find a location and time which is nearby (within a day) and ideal to your time frame (within 24 hours of when you are hoping for.) The location bonus is +3.</br></li>  <li>Success: As critical success, except either your location is far (within 1d4+1 days) or the timing is bad (within 1d4+1 days of your ideal timing) and the location bonus is +2</br></li>  <li>Failure: As success, except your location is far AND the timing is bad, and the location bonus is +1.</br></li>  <li>Critical Failure: You are unable to ascertain any useful information, and cannot try again for 2d4 days.</li></ul><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="prepared-magic" level="4">Prepared Magic</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Prepared Spells are basically just feats with a special modification. These feats are purchased using character points, but at a greatly reduced cost (1/10th their normal cost.) They have additional rules, as noted in the section on designing Spells later.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Magical Miscasts (Prepared Casting)</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>If you critically fail when Casting Prepared Magic, in addition to accumulating double strain, you also suffer a magical miscast.

By default, this is a tool based on the kind of magic they use:</br><br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Arcane:</br> Wand, Rod, Staff</li>  <li>Divine:</br> Holy Symbol, Thurible, Book</br></li>  <li>Primal: Staff, Totem, Scepter</br></li>  <li>Any: Special Weapon</br><br /></br></li></ul><div>The prepared caster can cast Magic into the item as part of designating the item as a bonded item. They make the Cast Magic roll, and suffer any strain as part of the preparation. Later, they can spend the appropriate number of actions to Cast the stored Magic without needing to make a roll or suffer the resulting strain. Once they do this, the item no longer has any stored magic. They must have the item held in a hand to use it.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Designing Prepared Spells</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Prepared Magic spells are essentially designed like Abilities, only they cost 1/10th the Creation Points. Treat the fact that the effect is a spell as a Limit equal of whatever Tier spell you want it to be. It follows all the same rules as Limits in this regard, meaning you can use it to pay the matched Tier cost of multiple smaller Tier effects. <br /></br><br /></br>If you use normal Limits to pay for all the Tiers, and have no Tier requirements left, then use your effect basically has no Tier. Use the the rules for Effects with no Tier to determine the spell Tier below. <br /></br><br /></br>Effects with no Tier:</br> When selecting an effect with no Tier, use the effect's base cost to determine its Tier for purposes of creating a Prepared Magic Ability out of it:<br /></br><br /></br>F: 1-49</div><div>D: 50-89</br></div><div>C: 90-149</br></div><div>B: 150-199</br></div><div>A: 200+</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Activation</strong>: </br>All spells must be &quot;activated&quot;, which means if they don't have a default of &quot;Activation: Duration&quot; or &quot;Activation: Instantaneous&quot; you will need to apply the Limit of &quot;Requires Activation&quot; -- but you do get the limit reductions for it.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Verbal and Somatic Components:</strong> Spells always have verbal and somatic components (as per the limits, but you don't get the reduction for them). You can get rid of any one of these, but not both, as a 50% Boost. Getting rid of the verbal component is always a Tier C boost, as well.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="spontaneous-magic" level="4">Spontaneous Magic</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>(Warning: Spontaneous Magic is an option for advanced players, and requires extreme GM oversight given how much time at the gaming table creating magic on the fly can take up.)</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Spontaneous casters work very similarly to Prepared casters, except they don't know pre-built magical abilities like their Prepared cousins do. Instead, they dynamically create effects on the fly, as needed. At any time, a spontaneous caster can build a Magic Effect like any other feat, and use it in real time without having to pay any character points for it.</br><br /></br></div><div>These temporary feats have the following restrictions:</br><br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>If they have effects that otherwise have no Activation trait, they now have &quot;Activation: Duration.&quot;</br></li>  <li>They always have verbal and somatic components (as per the limits). You can get rid of any one of these, but not both, as a 50% Boost. Getting rid of the verbal component is always a Tier C boost, as well.</br></li>  <li>They cannot have the "Situational" limit, and if the effect requires you to select how 'dynamic' the effect is, you must pick the most. For example, the &quot;Creation&quot; effect has a field you have to select called &quot;Dynamics&quot; - which has four levels: The same exact object, same type of object, similar categories of object, or any object. As a spontaneous caster, when you with to use a &quot;creation&quot; effect, you must always select the &quot;any object&quot; category for purposes of determining the cost and tier of your effect.</br></li>  <li>They cannot have frequency limits of any kind, including those that limit access to their re-use, unless they apply to your access to the entire Sphere itself. </br></li>  <li>The maximum duration of any benefit to a character generated by the effect is 1 hour. Effects that impact the outside world have no maximum duration beyond the limits of building the feats.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Magical Miscasts (Spontaneous Caster)</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>If you critically fail when Casting Spontaneous Magic, in addition to the double accumulating strain, you also suffer a magical miscast. This means you were unable to contain the magical power summoned, which fires off in an unpredictable and detrimental fashion.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Roll on the following table:</div></div><div data-component-type="table"><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th data-column-width="151"><div>1d6</div></th><th data-column-width="549"><div>Miscast Result</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>1-2</div></td><td><div>The effect has a randomly determined but still applicable target, either within range, or within 60 feet if a shorter range than that.

Spontaneous casters have further limits, and spend their lives unlocking new tiers of capability for each of the spheres their tradition can use. Whereas a Prepared caster would spend their creation points on individual effects, a Spontaneous caster spends theirs on spheres, broadening the scope of what their dynamic power can accomplish.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>In order to generate a magical effect, a spontaneous caster must meet the Tier in the sphere most applicable for the effect.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Each Sphere has a rank associated with it, F-S.
