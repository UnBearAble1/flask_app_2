</br><h1>Hellcat</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Hellcats are devious predators native to the fiery pits of Hell. While the fiendish creatures appears as skeletal smilodons, their bones smoking with heat and dripping with boiling blood, they are not undead. They are living hellspawn with transparent flesh that reveals their burning skeletons. A typical hellcat is 9 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds.</div><div><br /></div><div>Left to their own devices, hellcats spend their time hunting--that is, seeking and stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As fiendish creatures, they do not require mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure of inflicting pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they resent being treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one may find themself made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths to coordinate elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect.</div><div><br /></div><div>Though they can't speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much except to make whispered threats and to acknowledge the orders of their diabolic masters.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up against foes they're unable to reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them. They often track potential victims and recruit allies, including other hellcats, to make coordinated attacks or ambushes against their foes.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Beast (Arcana, Nature)</div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fiend (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LE, Large, Beast, Fiend, Skirmisher</br></strong></div><div>Perception +9; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet</div><div>Languages Infernal; can't speak any language, telepathy 100 feet</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +10, Athletics +10, Intimidation +7, Stealth +10, Survival +7</div><div>Str +6, Dex +4, Con +4, Int +0, Wis +3, Cha +1</div><div><strong>AC 20 ; Fort +9 , Ref +11 , Will +7; +1 status to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 70; Resistances fire 10, physical 5 (except silver); Weaknesses good 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 35 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>:</br></div><div>Fearful Attack: The hellcat deals an additional 1d6 precision damage to frightened creatures.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reactions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Fade into the Light Reaction (divine, illusion)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Trigger The hellcat begins its turn in bright light;</br></li>      <li>Effect The hellcat becomes invisible until its no longer in bright light.
