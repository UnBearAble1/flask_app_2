Detection, revelation, and scrying effects pass right over you, your possessions, and your auras, detecting nothing unless the detecting effect is legendary. For example, detect magic would still detect other magic in the area but not any magic on you, true seeing wouldn't reveal you, locate or scrying wouldn't find you, and so on.</div></div>
