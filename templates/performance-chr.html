</br><h1>Performance (CHR)</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>You are skilled at a form of performance, using your talents to impress a crowd or make a living.</div><div><br /></div><div>Some performances require you to be more than just charismatic, and if you don't meet the demands of the art form or the audience, the GM might apply a penalty based on the relevant ability score. For example, if you're dancing and have a negative Dexterity modifier, you might take a penalty to your attempt at dancing. Likewise, if you are orating and have a negative Intelligence modifier, you might have to hope your raw Charisma can overcome the penalties from your intellectual shortcomings--or ask someone to help write your speeches!</div><div><br /></div><div>When you use an action that utilizes the Performance skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of performance. The GM might change these depending on the circumstances, but the most common performance-based traits are listed below.</div><div><br /></div><div>Act or Perform Comedy: <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/auditory" target="_blank">Auditory</a>, <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/linguistic" target="_blank">Linguistic</a>, and <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/visual" target="_blank">Visual</a></br></div><div>Dance: Move and <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/visual" target="_blank">Visual</a></br></div><div>Play an Instrument: <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/auditory" target="_blank">Auditory</a> and <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/manipulate" target="_blank">Manipulate</a></br></div><div>Orate or Sing: <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/auditory" target="_blank">Auditory</a> and <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/linguistic" target="_blank">Linguistic</a></br></div><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Untrained Actions</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><ul></br>  <li><a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/perform" target="_blank"><strong>Perform</strong></a>: When making a brief performance--one song, a quick dance, or a few jokes--you use the Perform action.</li></ul></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Trained Actions</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><ul></br>  <li><a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/earn-income" target="_blank"><strong>Earn Income</strong></a> by staging a performance.</li></ul></div>
