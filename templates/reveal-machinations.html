Attempt a Deception check against the target's Will DC. On a success, the revelation makes them <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//frightened" target="_blank">frightened</a> 2, and on a critical success they are frightened 3. In addition, you gain information about the subject as though you had attempted to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a> about them using an appropriate skill and received the same result on your roll. You can't use this ability against the same humanoid again until 1 day has passed and you've also successfully disguised yourself as a different person.</div></div>
