If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, select a non-cantrip spell in your spell repertoire that deals a different type of energy damage from that list, and roll to cast it as a spell of the same level as the spell you are applying this metamagic feat on. The spell you cast deals additional damage equal to 2x the tier of the secondary spell. The spell's total damage is divided evenly between the energy type of the spell you cast and the energy type of the secondary spell.</div></div>
