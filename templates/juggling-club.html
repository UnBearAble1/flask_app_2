While a juggling club deals less damage, the extra throwing distance its light weight allows is important for Juggling.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agile: </strong>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is -4 instead of -5, and -8 instead of -10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Nonlethal: </strong>An effect with this trait is not inherently deadly. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a -2 circumstance penalty.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Thrown 20 ft.: </strong>You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack, and it is a ranged weapon when thrown. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment specified in the weapon's Range entry.</div></div>
