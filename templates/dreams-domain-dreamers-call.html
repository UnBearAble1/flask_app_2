This can be to approach you, run away (as if it had the fleeing condition), Release what it's holding, Drop Prone, or stand in place. The creature follows this course of action as its first action after you Cast the Spell.</li>  <li>Critical Failure As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and it does nothing else.</li></ul></div>
