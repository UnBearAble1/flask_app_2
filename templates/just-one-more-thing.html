Reroll the failed check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check is the subject of a lead you're pursuing, double your bonus from Pursue a Lead on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.<br /></br><br /></br>You can also use this action if you failed, but didn't critically fail, at a check to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//lie" target="_blank">Lie</a>, <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//gather-information" target="_blank">Gather Information</a>, <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//make-an-impression" target="_blank">Make an Impression</a>, or <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//coerce" target="_blank">Coerce</a>. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.</div></div>
