You must shoot the ammunition before the end of your turn or the magic dissipates. The DC is your tradition skill DC (occultism, arcane, nature, or religion) or spellcasting DC. The arrows revert back to normal arrows after a minute once fired.<br /></br><br /></br>When an activated antler arrow hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or become stuck to the surface, taking the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//weapon-critical-specialization-effects" target="_blank">critical specialization effects</a> of a bow. If the hit with the antler arrow is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the Athletics check becomes the same as the DC for the reflex save of the arrow (instead of 10.)</div></div>
