</br><h1>Extradimensional Stash</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>6 Points</br></strong></div><div><strong>Thievery; Utility</br></strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: </br>Legendary in Thievery</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>When you perform sleight of hand, you fold space so that objects really do disappear. You create a small extradimensional space somewhere within your clothing that can hold up to 5 Bulk worth of objects. Though the space can hold a great amount of material, an object still needs to be able to fit through the opening of the sack to be stored inside. If the pocket is overloaded or broken, it ruptures and is ruined, causing the items inside to be lost forever. If it's turned inside out, the items inside spill out unharmed, but the pocket must be put right before it can be used again. A living creature placed inside the pocket has enough air for 10 minutes before it begins to suffocate, and it can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An item inside the pocket provides no benefits unless it's retrieved first. An item in the pocket can't be detected by magic that detects only things on the same plane. The pocket can only hold only up to 5 Bulk, has no Bulk of its own, and can be Interacted with using only one hand. In addition, when you <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//palm-an-object" target="_blank">Palm an Object</a>, you can place it directly into this extradimensional space as long as the space has sufficient free space to hold the object.</div></div>
