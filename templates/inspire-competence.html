This counts as having taken sufficient preparatory actions to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//aid" target="_blank">Aid</a> your ally on a skill check of your choice, regardless of the circumstances. When you later use the Aid reaction, you can roll Performance instead of the normal skill check, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead. If you are legendary in Performance, you automatically critically succeed.<br /></br><br /></br>The GM might rule that you can't use this ability if the act of encouraging your ally would interfere with the skill check (such as a check to Sneak quietly or maintain a disguise).</div></div>
