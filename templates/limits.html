</br><h1>Limits</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Limits serve three purposes:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>You must select one limit with a Limit number that matches the Base number of your effect.</br></li>  <li>Any additional limits reduce the Mod of your effect, making it cheaper to purchase</br></li>  <li>They are a great way to truly customize and focus your abilities, making them unique to your character.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Some limits have &quot;Modifications.&quot; You combine the numbers listed in these modifications with those listed in the limit to get a new total Limit number. For example, a limit that is Limit -4, coupled with one of its modifications listed as (Limit -1) would have a total Limit of -5.</br>Another example: a limit that is Limit -8, coupled with one of its modifications listed as (Limit +6) would have a total Limit of -2.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Limits are sorted from lowest to highest possible Mod of the limit.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Limit -1 through -3</h2></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Descriptive Trait: Uncommon [Limit -1]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>Your effect has the Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Light, Shadow, Good, Evil, lawful or Chaotic trait (or similarly obscure traits.) </br>The trait must make sense with the ability you are using, and as usual, stretching the spirit of the intended limit can cause the GM to veto your choice. You cannot take this limit if the effect already has one of these traits (for example, if an attack does Good damage, it automatically has the Good trait.) These added traits don't have any intrinsic properties, but may occasionally interact with NPC or creature abilities, or the story itself.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Linked: Alternate Effect [Limit -1]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>This effect is an alternate effect of another. </br>Linked Alternate Effects cannot be used in the same round (if they are encounter based) or same hour (if they are exploration based) as the others, and anything that impacts one ability automatically impacts the others.

An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it.

This means if your first action is to activate a 2-action ability, then on the next action you do nothing, and on the final action you can act again.</br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Requires Finesse Weapon [Limit -2]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>Applicable to: Special Attacks that use weapons (must include or modify a Strike with a weapon)</div><div><br /></div><div>You can only use this attack with a weapon that has the finesse trait. </br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Distracting [Limit -3]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>Applicable to: Effects with a duration greater than 1 round only.</div><div><br /></div><div>You can't use actions with the concentrate trait while this ability is active (note: this is most activated abilities)<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Flourish [Limit -3 or -6] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Applicable to: Encounter effects you may occasionally want to use more than once per round.</div><div><br /></div><div>This ability has the Flourish trait, so it can only be used once per round.<br /></br><br /></br>If you would have <em>regular</em> tactical use more than once per round, increase the Limit to [Limit -6]<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Very Obvious [Limit -3] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>This effect is impossible to hide, generating light and noise in some combination that makes it noticeable from a distance or around corners. Further, it leaves a signature residue of some kind that could be traced or tracked back to you. After 24 hours, these traces are -2 to perceive, and after one week, they disappear altogether.<br /></br><br /></br>If you attach this to an activated effect, which is already hard to hide, then this makes it <em>incredibly</em> loud / bright / obvious.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Point Blank [Limit -3] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Applicable to: Ranged attack effects with ranged weapons only.

It gains the &quot;Stance&quot; trait. This requires an action, and you remain in the stance until the combat is over. Incompatible with "Requires Activation" limit.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Volley: 30 feet [Limit -3] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Applicable to: Ranged attack effects only</div><div><br /></br>You are -2 to attack with this effect within 30 feet of your target.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Requires Focus Item [Limit -3]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>You have a specific focus item - an item that you channel your effect through - such as a wand, staff, lantern or book, that you must hold in your hand when activating. If you lose your focus item somehow, it requires replacement. This limit also includes (meaning you do not get any Limit levels from it) 3 levels of the &quot;Requires Recharge&quot; limit, but it is only applicable to </br>replacing the focus.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Reduced Range [Limit -2 or greater] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Applicable to: Effects with a default range only.<br /></br><br /></br>Limit -2 per range category reduction.<br /></br><br /></br>Your effect has a reduced default range category.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Limit -4 through -7 </h2></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Descriptive Trait: Common [Limit -4] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Applicable to: Offensive abilities.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Your effect has the Poison, Disease or Curse traits. You cannot select this limit if your ability already has this trait. </br>The trait must make sense with the ability you are using, and as usual, stretching the spirit of the intended limit can cause the GM to veto your choice. You cannot take this limit if the effect already has one of these traits</div><div><br /></div><div>These added traits don't have any intrinsic properties, but may occasionally interact with NPC or creature abilities, or the story itself.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Requires Free Hand [Limit -4] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Applicable to: Encounter effects only, and you don't have another limit that also includes the need for a free hand (such as the manipulate limit)</br></div><div><br /></div><div>In order to use this ability, you must have a free hand.</br>You can take this limit twice.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Visual [Limit -5] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Your effect has the Visual Trait. A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Auditory [Limit -6] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Your effect has the Auditory Trait. Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds, and depending on the target, also only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Injury [Limit -6] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Your effect has the Injury Trait, which means it can only be delivered with weapon attacks that deals damage. Typically this applies to poisons or other afflictions, specifically those created through Alchemy or with the "Is an Item" limit. Obviously this isn't applicable for most special attacks that already and innately deal damage or require strikes, or those with circumstantial restrictions that already require them to be delivered with successful strikes. <br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Release Weapon [Limit -6]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Applicable to: Encounter effects only</div><div><br /></div><div>In order to use this effect (typically an attack, though not always) you must release the weapon you are wielding. For the duration of this ability, you cannot reclaim your weapon. This feat is only usable if the weapon is part of the effect's application, such as stabbing a concealed foe to reveal their location or wrapping your flail around a foe's legs to give it a speed penalty.</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Inhaled [Limit -7] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Your effect is an inhaled threat.

You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. You must have a free hand to do so. Creatures without a suitable appendage can't perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions. <br /></br><br /></br>If you combine this limit with &quot;Requires Free Hand&quot;, you will need both hands free.</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Mental [Limit -8] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Your effect has the Mental Trait, and has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Must Maintain Touch [Limit -8] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Applicable to: Melee attack effects with duration only</div><div><br /></br>You must keep one hand on the target to maintain the duration of the effect, and the effect ends if the target is no longer within reach of your hand.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Requires Concentration [Limit -8]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Applicable to: any feat that provides a benefit for a limited (but non-instantaneous) duration, such as those with the 'requires activation' limit.</br><br /></br></div><div>You can only use this effect while you maintain concentration. You may only select this limit if your effect is activated, and has a non-instantaneous duration of some kind. If this ability didn't already have it, it gains the Concentrate trait. Additionally, if you take damage or gain a negative condition other than flat-footed while using this ability, you must make a DC 11 flat check or the ability is disrupted.</br></div><div></br></div><div>Limit Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The Flat Check DC is 16 (Limit -2)<br /></br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Close Range Weakness [Limit -9] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Applicable to: Special Defenses Only<br /></br><br /></br>This ability is only applicable against incoming attacks greater than 5 feet away. This limit is only available to effects that <em>would otherwise be much more optimal</em> if they applied to attacks that would hit in melee, typically Special Defense abilities such as concealment or mirror image.</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Emotion [Limit -9] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Your effect has the Emotion trait (which includes the Mental Trait).<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Inhaled [Limit -9] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Your effect has the Inhaled Trait, which means it can only be delivered when breathed in.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Duration: Sustained [Limit -10]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Applicable to: any effect with a duration of or greater than than 2/1d4 rounds, or an affliction that can continue beyond 2 rounds.<br /></br><br /></br>You must spend an action each round to continue the duration of this effect.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Linked: Secondary Attack Effect [Limit -10] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>This effect is a secondary effect of another. In order to even make an attack roll with it or activate it, the linked primary attack effect must succeed.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Press [Limit -11]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Applicable to: &quot;Attack&quot; trait effects only</div><div><br /></div><div>This effect has the press trait, so it may only be used when you are suffering a Multiple Attack Penalty.</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Limit -12 through -15</h2></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Chaotically Dynamic [Limit -12] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>You can bundle together multiple effects into a single ability that is difficult to predict. A chaotically dynamic ability must be made from at least three different effects. Each must have an activation and they must all share the same activation actions and restrictions as well duration.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Once you activate the bundle ability, you roll randomly to determine which ability actually benefits you for the duration.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>The reduction from this limit applies to the most expensive of your abilities bundled into this set, the rest of the bundled abilities have -100% cost.</div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Duration: Linked [Limit -4 through Limit -12]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>When you create an ability with multiple effects that have various conditional durations (such as an ability that gives a creature persistent damage as well as the grabbed condition), you can give two or more of those effects this limit (any of the ones that now can end earlier than they would have). They now all end if any one of them ends.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>The reduction and tier for each effect is based on the nature of the conditional duration:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>If linked to a Persistent Damage effect (Limit -4)</br></li>  <li>A condition that ends early if hostile actions are taken against the target (Limit -12)</br></li>  <li>A condition that ends early if the creature escapes </br>(Limit -8)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Example: You have an attack that enfeebles a creature for 1d4 rounds, and causes 1d6 persistent acid damage.

On a failure, the effect ends early. There are no other benefits or penalties for making the check (no possibility of a critical success or failure) <br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Reduced Skill Roll [Limit -14] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Applicable On: Effects that couple with or require existing skill rolls or activities of some kind.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>DCs are 5 points higher on skill checks you make on rolls associated with this effect.</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Risky: Activity Consequences [Limit -2 through Limit -14]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Failure to perform some check involved in the task (an action that is a component of the ability, or something like the 'Requires Skill Check' limit, or a required attack roll) causes you to suffer the effect of a critical failure - or the effect of a critical failure on a related, connected activity. This option is only selectable if there is inherent risk or a negative outcome on a critical failure of the connected task.</br>(Example: if you have a special ability that requires you make a Recall Knowledge check, you could say you suffer the consequences of a critical failure on that check even on a normal failure, or you could say that if you critically fail an Aid check when climbing, you suffer the critical failure results of the climb check itself ).</div><div><br /></br>This Limit is based on how likely you are to fail the roll:</div><ul></br>  <li>None. You aren't specialized in the right skill anyway.</br>(Limit -14)</li>  <li>Somewhat. Something you are specialized in, but not your normal role in the party.</br>(Limit -10)</br></li>  <li>Relevant. One of your roles in the party.</br>You have some points invested in abilities around the activity. (Limit -6)</li>  <li>Primarily.

Any character can only have a maximum of 3 focus points, but they can have more focus spells than that.<br /></br><br /></br>You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during your daily preparations. You can also use the Refocus activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise re-attune yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain a Focus Point.<br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li><em>Refocus</br> (Concentrate, Exploration)</em></br>    <ul></br>      <li><em>Requirements: You have a focus pool, and you have spent at least 1 Focus Point since you last regained any Focus Points.</em></li>      <li><em>You spend 10 minutes performing deeds to restore your magical connection. This restores 1 Focus Point to your focus pool. The deeds you perform are based on the theme of your feat. If the feat uses Warrior, then perhaps you perform a complex set of weapon kata to refocus. If it's religion, then maybe simple prayer and atonement will do. Work with your GM.</br></em></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>The key thing to remember about the refocus action is that it only restores 1 focus point each time you do it, and you cannot do it unless you've spent at least 1 focus point since the last time you've refocused. This is important to remember because if you have spent more than 1 focus point (maybe by casting a Focus spell that actually costs 2 or 3 focus points to cast) you won't be able to restore back to your full focus point allotment until your next Daily Preparations.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>A note on Secret Checks: Sometimes you may wish to create a focus spell that influences secret checks, even if you don't have an activation limit as well. In these cases, simply declare that you are using the focus spell prior to the check being rolled, and the GM will use your ability in its best possible way. For example, if you have the Enhanced Activity Use effect &quot;reroll critical failures&quot; for stealth, but the stealth check is a secret check, normally you wouldn't know to use the ability. By declaring prior to the roll, and spending the focus point, the GM will automatically reroll the secret check if it critically failed. Even if it didn't, however, you would still spend the focus point.</br></div><div><br /></br>Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>This focus spell costs 2 focus points to cast. You can only take this ability if you have at least 2 focus points, and at least one of the other ones than the one granted by this feat came from a feat with a final total cost of at least half of this feat's final cost. Note, you still only receive 1 focus point for selecting this limit.
