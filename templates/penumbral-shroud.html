The target perceives <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//light" target="_blank">light</a> as one step lower than it actually is (bright light becomes dim light, for example), affecting their ability to sense creatures and objects accordingly. The shroud also provides the target a +1 status bonus to saving throws against light effects. While this effect is helpful to creatures sensitive to light, if the creature is unwilling, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the shroud and reduce the effect.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The target is unaffected.</li>  <li>Success The effect lasts for 1 round</li>  <li>Failure The effect lasts its normal duration.</li></ul></div>
