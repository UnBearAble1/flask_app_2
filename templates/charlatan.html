When you activate a magic item to generate a spell effect, attempt a Deception check. If you succeed against an onlooker's Perception DC, to that onlooker, you appear to Cast that Spell instead. Onlookers who successfully <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//recognize-spell" target="_blank">Recognize</a> the Spell realize you used a magic item, though those who later successfully <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//identify-magic" target="_blank">Identify</a> the Magic still can't determine that the source of the effect was a magic item.</div></div>
