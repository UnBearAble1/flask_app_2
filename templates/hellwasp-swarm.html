</br><h1>Hellwasp Swarm</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 7</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Hellwasps' infernal nature allows them to collectively inhabit and control humanoid corpses, and they use this ability to infest and horrify large swathes of territory unless destroyed. While individual hellwasp poses little threat, these fist-sized insects instinctively form into aggressive swarms that will viciously attack any creature approaching their colony, the lone exception being powerful fiends.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hellwasp swarms have a rudimentary intelligence focused on the protection and expansion of their colony. They can understand Infernal but are incapable of speech. They sometimes obey simple commands from a lawful fiend more powerful than their swarm, but there is no nuance or understanding to this obedience, and if left alone for more than a day they stop obeying and return to their colony.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fiend (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LE, Large, Fiend, </strong><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/swarm" target="_blank"><strong>Swarm</strong></a><strong>, Lurker</br></strong></div><div>Perception +11; darkvision</div><div>Languages Infernal; (can't speak any language)</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +11, Stealth +11</div><div>Str +0, Dex +4, Con +6, Int -3, Wis +2, Cha -2</div><div>AC 20 ; Fort +8 , Ref +12 , Will +10</div><div><strong>HP 80; Immunities precision, swarm mind; Resistances bludgeoning 5, fire 10, piercing 10, slashing 5; Weaknesses area damage 10, splash damage 10</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 20 feet; fly 40 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Hellwasp Stings; Single Action, Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 3d8 piercing damage (DC 21 basic Reflex save).

Its size changes to that of the corpse and it loses its piercing and slashing resistances, fly Speed, and Hellwasp Stings. It gains a fist melee Strike with a +11 attack modifier that deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus 2d8 piercing damage and hellwasp venom.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>The hellwasp swarm gains 20 temporary Hit Points when it Infests a Corpse; when these temporary HP are depleted, the corpse falls apart and the swarm Abandons the Corpse automatically.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Abandon Corpse; Single Action; Requirements: The hellwasp swarm is controlling a corpse with Infest Corpse; Effect The hellwasp swarm leaves its host corpse, which dies instantly and becomes a normal corpse in all respects. The hellwasp swarm expands out from that space to its normal size.</li>  <li>Torturous Buzz; Two Actions (auditory, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, occult) The swarm emits a distracting, cacophonous buzzing. Each creature within 20 feet must attempt a DC 21 Will save.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune for 1 minute.</li>      <li>Success The creature is unaffected.</li>      <li>Failure The creature is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/confused" target="_blank">confused </a>for 1 round.</li>      <li>Critical Failure The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul></div>
