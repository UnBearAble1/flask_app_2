When you meet someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/make-an-impression" target="_blank">Make an Impression</a> on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a -5 penalty to the check. If you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.</div></div>
