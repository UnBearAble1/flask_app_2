</br><h1>Abandoned Zealot</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Once devout followers whose faith proved false, abandoned zealots return from the doorstep of the afterlife after being denied the eternal reward they expected. Consumed by self-loathing for the lives they squandered to false faiths and empty creeds, these lost souls serve as terrifying and implacable--yet ultimately pathetic--foes. A shapeless mass of smoke and shadow coils behind their broken masks. As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping.</div><div><br /></div><div>Abandoned zealots are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal wizard as a god--a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots might arise from a true religion if they've been misled about that faith's true tenets or aims. This situation could easily result from the cruel schemes and predations of sinister beings, such as shrine skelms and the blasphemous devils known as deimavigga.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Spirit (Occultism)</div><div>Recall Knowledge - Undead (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CE, Medium, Incorporeal, Spirit, Undead, Lurker</strong></div><div>Perception +10; darkvision, lifesense 60 feet</div><div>Sense Apostate: (detection, divination, divine) An abandoned zealot can sense the presence and direction of false priests within 500 feet of them.
