</br><h1>Myceloid</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 4</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>The ambulatory fungus creatures called myceloids are notorious for spreading deadly purple pox, controlling creatures' minds, and devouring humanoid flesh. For a myceloid colony, any battle with humanoids is cause for excitement, as this new fodder presents so many delicious possibilities.</div><div><br /></div><div>Myceloids consider humanoids to have an ideal life cycle of four simple steps. During childhood, they wander naive and afraid, unaware of myceloid colonies. In adulthood, humanoids discover their true purpose as they taste purple pox and become enslaved by the myceloids' spores. Next, they die, giving rise to a new myceloid. They're then sent on to the afterlife upon becoming a myceloid meal. Eating humanoid flesh is not a necessity--a myceloid can survive on any decaying matter--but it's certainly a pleasure.</div><div><br /></div><div>Myceloids rarely make alliances, but when they do, they invite their new allies to share a meal to seal the pact. Few outsiders appreciate this hospitality. Most myceloids have deep purple caps studded with off-white lumps. Their necks and bodies bear resemblance to the stipes of tough, leathery fungi. Smaller mushrooms often grow on a myceloid's body, which the creatures view as either adornments or particularly convenient snacks. They stand roughly as tall as a dwarf, with comparably stout builds.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fungus (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>NE, Medium, Fungus, Controller</br></strong></div><div>Perception +7; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet</div><div>Languages Undercommon; telepathy 100 feet (myceloids and those afflicted by purple pox only)</div><div>Skills Stealth +7, Survival +6</div><div>Str +4, Dex +3, Con +4, Int -1, Wis +2, Cha +0</div><div><strong>AC 16; Fort +5 , Ref +7 , Will +9</strong></div><div><strong>HP 24; Weaknesses slashing 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 20 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features:</br></strong></div><div>Spore Pop: If a myceloid is reduced to 0 HP by a critical hit, it pops, forcing it to immediately Emit Spores, even if it has already used the ability that day.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Fist: Melee Single Action; +7 (+2 / -3), Damage 2d4+4 bludgeoning plus purple pox</li>  <li>Emit Spores; Single Action; Frequency once per day; Effect The myceloid expels spores in a 10-foot burst centered on a corner of its own space. This cloud lasts until the start of the myceloid's next turn. Each creature that is in the cloud or enters it is exposed to purple pox.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Purple Pox (disease) Myceloids are immune; Saving Throw DC 19 Fortitude; Onset 1 minute;</br>        <ul></br>          <li>Stage 1 2d6 poison damage and <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//stupefied" target="_blank">stupefied</a> 1 (1 day);</br></li>          <li>Stage 2 6d6 poison damage, stupefied 3, and the creature is compelled to seek out the nearest myceloid colony--this compulsion is a mental emotion effect (1 day);</br></li>          <li>Stage 3 The creature dies.
