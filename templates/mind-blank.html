The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against mental effects. Mind blank attempts to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/counteracting" target="_blank">counteract</a> any detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell tier as if it were 1 higher than its actual tier. On a success, the divination effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/detect-magic" target="_blank">detect magic</a> would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.</div></div>
