</br><h1>Clan Dagger</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>1 Point</strong></div><div><strong>Cultural Training; Weapons</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Your people use ceremonial clan daggers as part of their cultural rituals. You gain several benefits:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>In your hands, a clan dagger's damage improves by one step (typically to 2d6.)</br></li>  <li>You are proficient in and get one <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//clan-dagger-3460910" target="_blank">clan dagger</a> of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. Selling this dagger is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of others of your ancestry.</li>  <li>When you use an Interact action to gain a circumstance bonus to AC from your clan dagger's parry trait, you can grant the circumstance bonus to an adjacent ally instead of gaining it yourself. You can use multiple Interact actions to protect multiple allies, or to protect yourself and an ally. The ally benefits from the bonus to AC only when they are adjacent to you.</li>  <li>For 2 actions, Make two clan dagger Strikes against different targets. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally to these Strikes. You then use an Interact action to gain the +1 circumstance bonus to your AC from your clan dagger's parrying trait. If the hand you're not holding the dagger with is empty, you can use your clan dagger's sheath to block attacks as well. The circumstance bonus to your AC from parrying increases to a +2 against any target you hit with a Strike this turn.</li></ul><div><br /></div></div>
