You must be wielding a melee weapon, and you perform this spell's somatic component by swinging the weapon in a downward arc. You deal normal melee damage for your weapon, including all appropriate bonuses, penalties, modifiers, and properties, to each creature in the spell's area; they must each attempt a basic Fortitude save. A creature that critically fails this save also suffers any additional effect you would normally inflict with your weapon on a critical hit; if the creature that critically fails its save is also immune to critical hits, it merely fails the save instead.<br /></br><br /></br>You can convert all the physical damage from this spell into positive damage against all undead creatures in the area.</div></div>
