</br><h1>Bladed Hoop</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Price</strong></br>2 gp, 5 sp;</br><strong>Damage</strong></br>2d6 S;</br><strong>Bulk</strong></br>1<br /></br><strong>Hands</strong></br>0+<br /></br><strong>Category</strong></br>Advanced<br /></br><strong>Group</strong> Knife; <strong>Traits</strong> Finesse, Sweep, Two-Hand 2d8, Uncommon</div><div><br /></div><div>This circular hoop has blades along its outer edge. You can wield it in two hands (using the two-hand damage) or by spinning it around an arm. While you spin the hoop, it gains the free-hand trait. Setting the hoop spinning takes 1 Interact action. In addition to the normal restrictions of the free-hand trait, extended use of the arm for locomotion (such as to Climb) interferes with the hoop's spinning and forces you to Release the hoop. You can't spin a hoop underwater. Keeping the hoop spinning requires a free action each round, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. You can keep a hoop spinning as an exploration activity, but doing so for more than 10 minutes makes you fatigued, similarly to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//hustle" target="_blank">Hustling</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Sweep:</strong></div><div>This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Two-Hand 2d8:</strong></div><div>This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone.</br></div></div>
