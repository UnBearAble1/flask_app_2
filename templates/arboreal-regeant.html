They take an especially long view of affairs and never act brashly or without much deliberation. They occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share news and pass their wisdom down to the arboreal wardens that have sprouted under their watch. In times of grave danger, all the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting to plan and, eventually, act upon a threat.</div><div><br /></div><div>The typical arboreal regent is 30 feet tall, has a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and weighs 4,500 pounds.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Plant (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>NG, Huge, Plant, Lurker </br></strong></div><div>Perception +11; low-light vision</div><div>Languages Arboreal, Common, Sylvan; speak with plants</div><div>Skills Athletics +14, Diplomacy +9, Intimidation +9, Nature +10, Stealth +5 (+11 in forests)</div><div>Str +7, Dex -1, Con +6, Int +1, Wis +4, Cha +2</div><div><strong>AC 20 ; Fort +8 , Ref +12 , Will +10</strong></div><div><strong>HP 100; Resistances bludgeoning 5, piercing 5; Weaknesses axes 5, fire 10</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Branch; Melee Single Action: +11 [+6/+1] (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8+7 bludgeoning</li>  <li>Root; Melee Single Action: </br>+11 [+6/+1] (trip), Damage 2d8+7 bludgeoning</li>  <li>Rock; Ranged Single Action: </br>+11 [+6/+1] (brutal, range increment 120 feet), Damage 2d8+7 bludgeoning</li>  <li>Awaken Tree; Two Actions (concentrate, primal) The arboreal regent causes a tree within 180 feet to uproot itself and fight as a minion using the statistics for an <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/awakened-tree" target="_blank">awakened tree</a>.
