</br><h1>Shoulder Slam</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>2 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Cultural Training; Fighting Style</strong></div><div><strong>2 Actions; </strong><br /></br>Take a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/step" target="_blank">Step</a> into the square of a foe that is your size or smaller, and the foe must move into the empty space directly behind it, even if doing so places it in harm's way. The foe can attempt a Fortitude saving throw against your Athletics DC to block your Step. If the foe attempts this saving throw, unless it critically succeeds, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to 10 plus your Strength modifier. If the foe can't move into an empty space (if it is surrounded by solid objects or other creatures, for example), you cannot use this move.</div></div>
