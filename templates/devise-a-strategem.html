Prerequisite: Expert in Warrior</strong><br /></br>You assess a foe's weaknesses in combat and use them to formulate a plan of attack against your enemy. Choose a creature you can see and roll a d20. If you Strike the chosen creature later this round, you must use the result of the roll you made to Devise a Stratagem for your Strike's attack roll instead of rolling. You make this substitution only for the first Strike you make against the creature this round, not any subsequent attacks.<br /></br><br /></br>When you make this substitution, you can also add your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, provided your Strike uses an <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//agile" target="_blank"><em>agile</em></a> or <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//finesse" target="_blank"><em>finesse</em></a> melee weapon, an <em>agile</em> or <em>finesse</em> unarmed attack, a ranged weapon (which must be agile or finesse if it's a melee weapon with the thrown trait), or a sap. If you use your intelligence modifier in this way, you also add 3d6 precision damage to the strike.</div></div>
