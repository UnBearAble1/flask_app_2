You can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you're a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, Stealing requires 2 manipulate actions instead of 1, and you take a -5 penalty.</div></div>
