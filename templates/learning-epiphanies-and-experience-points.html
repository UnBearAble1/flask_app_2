</br><h1>Learning, Epiphanies and Experience Points</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div></br>When trying to learn a new spell for your spellcaster repertoire, a new formula for your list of Alchemist formulas, or to learn new class feats, there are three steps:</br></div><div><br /></div><div>1. Learn how to do the ability. Characters can learn abilities using teachers, research materials, trying to innovate it themselves, or through sheer lucky epiphany. </br>Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, as described below.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>2. Add the ability to the In-Development list. </br>Once your character has learned how to do the ability, it goes onto their in-development list. This means they are now perfecting the ability for field use.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>3. Spend Experience Points on it. Characters are always perfecting their In-Development abilities. Once they spend the experience point cost required to purchase the ability, it then gets added to their list of abilities they can use.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>The time listed in all of the steps and options below is in hours, instead of days or weeks of downtime, because often your character won't have the downtime to dedicate days or weeks to learning - instead, they will spend a few hours each night working on the technique. The maximum amount of time a character can invest into learning each day (due to diminishing returns, limits on concentration, etc) is 10 hours.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Here are the ways your character can try to learn new abilities:</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Innovate it themselves:</strong> Assuming your character meets the prerequisites for a feat, they can try to use their requisite knowledge and know-how to innovate it through a long period of trial and error. This often means 'reinventing the wheel', teaching themselves bad form and having to correct it, and a great deal of elbow grease and thought spent before coming up with anything usable.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Innovating an ability yourself takes 200 hours, minus 50 hours per tier you exceed the prerequisites of the feat by. For example, if you are learning a feat with the highest prerequisite being Expert, and you are Legendary, it would only take you 100 hours (or about 10 days of dedicated time) to learn this ability.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Find a teacher</strong>: You find a PC or NPC that knows the feat, spell, or formula you want to learn. NPCs are often not willing to divulge their secrets, or spend the extreme lengths of time it takes to teach them without proper motivation (often meaning money, but sometimes favors as well.)</br>The higher the tier ability, the less likely you are to find a teacher. </br><br /></br></div><div>Learning from a teacher takes 100 hours, minus 50 hours per tier you exceed the prerequisites of the feat by, with a minimum of 10 hours. For example, if you are learning a feat with the highest prerequisite being Expert, and you are Legendary, it would only take you 10 hours (or 1 day of dedicated time) to learn this ability.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Research</strong>: It is possible your character could hit the books, either in a library or a treasure trove of forgotten lore, to learn a spell, formula or feat. Books with useful information are often locked away or hoarded, and the odds of finding a book about a very specific feat, spell or formula you want (that's usable for your character) are not good, especially as the tier goes up.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Learning from research takes 150 hours, minus 50 hours per tier you exceed the prerequisites of the feat by. For example, if you are learning a feat with the highest prerequisite being Expert, and you are Legendary, it would only take you 50 hours (or about 5 days of dedicated time) to learn this ability.</div><div></br></div><div><strong>Epiphanies</strong>: The fastest, though least reliable way to learn is by sheer stroke of inspiration, or epiphany. As your character adventures, the GM will let you know if certain moments or discoveries have given your character new insight into a spell, formula, or feat (similar to the sudden bursts of insight or genius inventors and artists have). Here's what you need to know:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>You have absolutely no control over what kind of spell, formula or feat the GM will give you as an epiphany, though depending on the breadth of your ability they may give you some limited choices.</br></li>  <li>The ability will be offered at a discount to it's cost.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Learning from epiphanies takes 20 hours, minus 5 hours per tier you exceed the prerequisites of the feat by. For example, if you are learning a feat with the highest prerequisite being Expert, and you are Legendary, it would only take you 10 hours (or about a day of dedicated time) to learn this ability.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Example Epiphanies:</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>After a particularly harrowing encounter with ghosts, in which a character was driven to Frightened 4, the GM decides that experience has given the character insights into the nature of fear. They give that character an epiphany about any feat of their choice that relates to the Frightened condition.</br></li>  <li>After successfully solving a complicated mystery involving a hidden cult, the GM grants the standout detective of the group an epiphany about any Perception or Society feat of their choice.</br></li>  <li>After being brought to zero hit points for the second time in a day, the GM grants a character an epiphany about any Fortitude feat of their choice, or any feat that relates to hit points, death or dying.</br></li>  <li>After a hard-won battle with a Manticore, the GM grants a spell-caster an epiphany about any spell related to monstrosities or monsters.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Spending Experience:</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>As your character adventures in the world, they earn experience points. Typically, this is 1 experience point per session, with optional experience rewarded based on specific in world events:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>One Point can be awarded for completing a major objective or milestone (typically finishing a quest, though possibly complete a segment of a larger quest.) This should only happen every other session or so, but in some cases they made add up to more than once in a single session.</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Additional points can be awarded if the characters complete a massive multi-part quest, or substantially better their world in a massive way.</br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>One Point may be awarded for the party enduring incredible hardship - maybe as the result of a total defeat, a major setback, or a failure in some way.</br></li>  <li>One Point is awarded to any character who reaches Dying 3, with a limit of 1 point gained this way per session.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>As per learning above, your characters can only spend experience points on items that appear in their &quot;In-Development Ability List&quot;</div><div><br /></div><div>Experience is spent on a 1:1 basis for feats, as per their listed costs.
