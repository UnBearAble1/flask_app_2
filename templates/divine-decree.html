This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. You deal 7d10 damage to creatures in the area; each creature must attempt a Fortitude save. Creatures with an alignment that matches the one you chose are unaffected by the spell. Those that neither match nor oppose it treat the result of their saving throw as one degree better and don't suffer effects other than damage.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected.</li>  <li>Success The creature takes half damage.</li>  <li>Failure The creature takes full damage and is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//enfeebled" target="_blank">enfeebled</a> 2 for 1 minute.</li>  <li>Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute.
