</br><h1>Hit Locations</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>It is possible to target parts of a creature when attacking it, though it only really matters if a Serious or Grievous wound is then inflicted. If such a wound is inflicted when a creature hasn't specified where it was targeting (usually because they didn't want to incur the penalty to hit a specific called location), a random roll is used to determine the most convenient target that was available for the attack (or in the case of area of effect abilities, where in the body the most damage was randomly centralized). This random hit location doesn't penalize the attack at all.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Locations Rolls and Results:</br></strong></div><div>Pen. = The penalty to target this part of the body.
