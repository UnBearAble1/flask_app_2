</br><h1>Ritual Rules</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>When you take charge of a ritual, you are its primary caster, and others assisting you are secondary casters. You can be a primary caster for a ritual even if you can't cast spells - but you must know the ritual. </br>You must also have the required proficiency tier in the skill used for the ritual's primary check (see Checks below), and as the primary caster, you must attempt this skill check to determine the ritual's effects. The primary skill check determines the tradition. Rituals do not require spell slots to cast.</br></div><div><br /></div><div></br>A ritual always takes at least 1 hour to perform, and often longer. While a ritual is a downtime activity, it's possible--albeit risky--to perform a ritual during exploration with enough uninterrupted time. A ritual's casting time is usually listed in days. Each day of casting requires 8 hours of participation in the ritual from all casters, with breaks during multiday rituals to allow rest. One caster can continue a multiday ritual, usually with some light chanting or meditation, while the other casters rest. All rituals require material, somatic, and verbal components throughout their casting time.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Learning Rituals</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Learning a ritual does not count against any limits on spells in your spell repertoire or on any other normal spellcasting ability. Rituals are never common, though if you look hard, you can probably find someone who can perform an uncommon ritual for you. They may still be unwilling to teach it to you.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Cost</strong></br></div><div><br /></div><div>A ritual's Cost entry lists valuable components required to cast the ritual. If a ritual doesn't have any such components, it won't have a Cost entry. The cost is consumed when you attempt the primary skill check.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Secondary Casters</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Many rituals need additional secondary casters, who also don't need to be able to cast spells. Unlike a primary caster, a secondary caster doesn't need a minimum tier of skill proficiency. The Secondary Casters entry, if present, indicates the minimum number of secondary casters required.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Checks</strong></br></div><div><br /></div><div>At the ritual's culmination, you must attempt the skill check listed in the Primary Check entry to determine the ritual's outcome. Primary checks usually have an<a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//simple-dcs-by-tier" target="_blank"> extremely hard DC</a> for their tier. As with other downtime activities, fortune and misfortune effects can't modify your checks for the ritual, nor can bonuses or penalties that aren't active throughout the process. The GM can adjust the DCs of rituals, add or change primary or secondary checks, or even waive requirements to fit specific circumstances. For example, performing a ritual in a location where ley lines converge on the night of a new moon might make a normally difficult ritual drastically easier.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Secondary Checks</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Often, a ritual requires secondary checks to represent aspects of its casting, usually with a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//simple-dcs-by-tier" target="_blank">basic DC</a> of the tier of the ritual. A different secondary caster must attempt each secondary check. If there are more secondary casters than checks, the others don't attempt any. Secondary casters attempt their checks before you attempt the primary check; no matter their results, the ritual proceeds to the primary check. Secondary checks affect the primary check depending on their results.</div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Critical Success</strong></br>You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the primary check.</li>  <li><strong>Success</strong></br>No bonus or penalty.</li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong></br>You take a -4 circumstance penalty to the primary check.</li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong></br>As failure, and you reduce the degree of success of the primary skill check by one step.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
