</br><h1>Resting</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Characters require 8 hours of sleep each day. Though resting typically happens at night, a group gains the same benefits for resting during the day. Either way, they can gain the benefits of resting only once every 24 hours. A character who rests for 8 hours recovers in the following ways:</div><ul></br>  <li>The character regains Hit Points equal to their Constitution modifier to each wound they have.</br></li>  <li>The character loses the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//fatigued" target="_blank">fatigued</a> condition.</li>  <li>The character reduces the severity of the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//doomed" target="">doomed</a> and <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//drained" target="_blank">drained</a> conditions by 1.</li>  <li>A group in exploration mode can attempt to rest, but they aren't entirely safe from danger, and their rest might be interrupted. The 8 hours of rest do not need to be consecutive, however, and after an interruption, characters can go back to sleep.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Sleeping in armor results in poor rest and causes a character to wake up fatigued. If a character would have recovered from fatigue, sleeping in armor prevents it.</div><div><br /></div><div>If a character goes more than 16 hours without going to sleep, they become fatigued.</div><div><br /></div><div>Taking <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//long-term-rest" target="_blank">long-term rest</a> for faster recovery is part of downtime and can't be done during exploration.</br></div></div>
