</br><h1>Minions</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong><br /></br><br /></br>Activation: Duration</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>This ability represents familiars, summoned creatures, animal companions, special mounts, animated dead, sidekicks, or any number of other creatures that will do your character's bidding.<br /></br></div><div>Minions are made just like characters, though typically have far less points. A minion can't control other creatures. </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br><br /></br></div><div>Commanding your Minion/s:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Your minion acts on your turn in combat, but only if you command it.</br></li>  <li>Commanding it is a verbal command as a free action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If you somehow have multiple minions, you can command all of them with the same free action.</br></li>  <li>You and your minion share a pool of 4 actions per round, but each of you must own at least 1 of those actions (meaning spending it or wasting it doing nothing.) If you somehow have multiple minions, the action pool is 3 actions plus the number of minions, but each of you must still own at least 1 of those actions. The maximum number of minions you can control is 3.</br></li>  <li>You share the same multiple attack penalty.</br></li>  <li>Minions add a different bonus to damage than players do (which is +10).</br></li>  <li>You also share your free actions (for purposes of trigger limits) and your reactions.</br></li>  <li>If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don't act at all. Those with limited intelligence or sapience will freeze up, flee, or otherwise be unable to act effectively without the bolstering of your guidance. The exception to this rule is if you are not in the combat at all, such as if you are in a separate location, then they act as NPCs controlled by the GM (but can still assist other party members in combat, or defend locations and the like.)</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>The cost of the minion ability is first based on how potent your minion is:<br /></br><br /></br><strong>Trivial</strong>: </br>[Base: 8, Mod -4]</div><ul></br>  <li>20 HP, </br>+0 Damage, 1 Skill Speciality, 3 creation points</br></li>  <li>Trivial Minions can have no effect greater than Base: 3, or with a total final cost of more than 2. <br /></br></li></ul><div><strong>Minor</strong>: [Base: 8, Mod +2]</br></div><ul></br>  <li>35 HP, +2 Damage, 2 Skill Specialties, 8 creation points</br></li>  <li>Minor Minions can have no effect greater than Base: 7, or with a total final cost of more than 5 points.<br /></br></li></ul><div><strong>Moderate</strong>: [Base: 12, Mod +4]</div><ul></br>  <li>60 HP, +4 Damage, 3 Skill Specialties, 12 creation points</li>  <li>Moderate Minions can have no effect greater than Base: 11, or with a total final cost of more than 8 points.<br /></br></li></ul><div><strong>Major</strong>: [Base: 16, Mod +8]</div><ul></br>  <li>85 HP, +6 Damage, 4 Skill Specialties, 20 creation points</li>  <li>Major Minions can have no effect greater than Base: 15, or with a total final cost of more than 11 points.<br /></br></li></ul><div><strong>Serious</strong>: [Base: 20, Mod +20]</div><ul></br>  <li>110 HP, +8 Damage, 5 Skill Specialties, 33 creation points</li>  <li>Serious Minions can have no effect greater than Base: 19, or with a total final cost of more than 13 points.<br /></br><br /></br></li></ul><div>Additional Minion Qualities:</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agency</strong>: This is a measure of your minion's ability to think for itself.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Mindless: Your minion cannot think for itself. If you aren't directing it it stands motionless. You can assign extremely simple tasks if you aren't around, such as guarding an area or moving logs from one area to another. The creature has the mindless trait, making it immune to mental effects.</br> (Mod +10) (why more expensive? Trap finding, bomb setting off, infinite fodder with no moral conundrum).</br>(Linked Skill: Thievery)</br></li>  <li>Limited: Your minion has animal level intellect. If you aren't directing it reverts to defending itself or following its animalistic instincts. You can assign extremely simple tasks if you aren't around, just like with a mindless minion. By taking a day of downtime, you can train your minion to perform slightly more complicated tasks than a mindless minion, but not as complex as a sapient one. You can command your minion to perform tasks that are obviously suicidal, such as jaunting down a trapped hallway in order to set off the traps, but your intentions are often known and it may disobey. Such commands require a DC 11 flat check. On a success you either trick the minion into not knowing the task is insidious, or your minion doesn't care that it is. On a failure, the minion knows the task is horrendous, and will refuse to follow your orders until you spend an hour placating or consoling it. Afterward, the DC flat check for similar distasteful tasks is DC 15, reducing by 1 per day until it is back to 11. On a critical failure the minion leaves your side for 24 hours to reflect.</br> (Default)</br></li>  <li>Sapient: Your minion is fully sapient. The minion is loyal to you, but they have their own personality and agenda, and in some rare cases may disobey you if they feel it is in your best interest. Further, they will almost always refuse orders to flagrantly kill themselves or be completely sacrificed in some way. (Mod +20)</br></li></ul><div><strong><br /></br>Persistence</strong>: This is a measure of how long your minion hangs around.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Summoned: Your minion is summoned from a pocket dimension or another realm, or created out of magic. The default range of a summoned creature is 30 feet.</br> By default, summoned minions are the same creature each time, so they carry their wounds and conditions over from when they were 'unsummoned' as if no time has passed. (Default)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Differential Summoning: You summon a different minion each time, though it has all the same statistics each time. This means the minion doesn't carry wounds or conditions over each time. (Base: +4, Mod +6)</li>      <li>Variable Summoning: As Differential Summoning, but you can actually design an entirely different minion each time you perform the summoning. (Base +8, Mod +12)</br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Permanent: Your minion lives in the world with you, and is always around. Unless you give it feats that state otherwise, they will need food, water, shelter and other survival necessities. You must select the 'requires replacements' limit (4 levels of difficulty), though the point reduction and Tier reduction is already included in this choice (Mod: +12)</br></li>  <li>Animated: Your minion is an animated object of some type, pick either "constructed object," "natural object," or "corpse/skeleton." By default, your animated minion has the same set of statistics each time, but each one is its own set of hit points and no wounds or conditions carry over. You can select both this and the "permanent" option for the ability to possibly permanently animate some creatures. As bizarre as it is, permanent constructed minions still require sustenance, sleep, etc, unless you purchase abilities saying they do not. (Mod +10) (why so expensive? Because you can use this ability to transport objects by animating them).</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Differential Animation: Depending on the type of object you animate, the minion is built differently. Work with your GM to come up with a set of abilities for common animated types. Unlike Variable Summoning for the Summoned Minion type, there is less room for interpretation on these differences. This could allow an animated rope to have special grappling traits, or animated armor to have damage resistance, for example. One variant could be allowing animated corpses to have some traits the creature had in life. (Base +4, Mod +12)</br></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Special Modifications:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Living Vehicle<strong>:</strong> Your minion is intended to be a vehicle or mobile home. It can be mostly hollow inside, allowing passengers to ride (or even live) within. This option is only available for the Mindless or Limited minion variant. (Mod +4)</br>    <ul></br>      <li>You can use one of the following limits to cancel out the price of a permanent size ability.</br></br>        <ul></br>          <li>Limited Mobility: Your minion has a 1-round delay on following commands, and limited ability to maneuver, making it very ineffective at using in combat.</br> (Allows your Vehicle to be Large)</br></li>          <li>Extremely Limited Mobility: As Limited Mobility, but also entirely lacks dextrous limbs or digits such as fingers. (Allows your vehicle to be Huge)</br><br /></br></li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Uncontrollable: The minion you create isn't actually your minion. It is a creature that exists, but you have no control over it, and it owes you no loyalty or allegiance. You also have no control over the alignment of the creature, which is usually Neutral or random (Base -8).</li></ul></div>
