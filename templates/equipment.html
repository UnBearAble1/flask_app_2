The item must fit within your pack. Once you draw the item, you immediately lose personal wealth equal to the value of the item, starting with any coin your character has (the GM has final say if you have no coin). If you lack the wealth to use this ability, or if the wealth would disappear in a non-discreet fashion or in a way that provides some other tactical benefit of any kind, this ability cannot be used. The spirit of this ability is a representation of your character's preplanning.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>This can include Tier F consumable magic items, if they were purchasable in a settlement you have been in within the past month (or the very last settlement you were in, if you haven't been in one more than a month) (Base +4)</br></li>  <li>As above, but Tier D consumable magic items (Base +4, Mod +4)<br /></br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Repair Item</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>[Base: 3, Mod +1]</strong></div><div><strong>Activation: Instantaneous, Linked Skill: crafting</strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch</br></strong></div><div><strong>Target: 1 non-magical item of 1 bulk or less, that could otherwise be repaired with the &quot;Repair&quot; activity.</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You restore 10 hit points to a broken object, possibly removing the broken condition. You can only use this ability once per instance of damage on an object during a 24 hour period (meaning if an object has taken 33 points of damage, and you heal that object 10 hit points, you cannot use this power to heal those other 23 points of damage until 24 hours have passed. If something else damages the item later, you can use this power to heal that damage. You can reduce this time using boosts.)</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Heal +10 HP (mod +2)</br></li>  <li>Heal +20 HP (mod +4)</br></li>  <li>Heal +30 HP (base +1, Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>Heal +40 HP (base +5)</br></li>  <li>Per +1 Bulk (Mod +2)</br></li>  <li>The object can be magical.

Consider adding limits to give these supplies limited duration.</br></div></div></div></div>
