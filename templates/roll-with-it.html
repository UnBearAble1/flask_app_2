Your foe can move you any distance of its choice up to 30 feet in a direction of its choice (this is not forced movement, and it triggers reactions as normal). You fall <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/prone" target="_blank">prone </a>and are <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/stunned" target="_blank">stunned </a>1. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. On a success, you take minimum damage from the attack, and on a critical success, if the attack was a critical hit, you don't take double damage from the critical hit.</div></div>
