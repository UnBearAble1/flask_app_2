This is most useful when you want to prove your scholarly credibility or impress someone quickly. Roll a check with a skill that can be used to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a> in which you have expert proficiency, using the result entry for the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//perform" target="_blank">Perform</a> action. Like Performing, Storytelling rarely has an effect on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers--or even change their attitudes--if the GM sees fit. This action is not a Performance and cannot be used in place of anything that requires you to Perform.</div></div>
