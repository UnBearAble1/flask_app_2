</br><h1>Splash</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Most bombs also have the splash trait. When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a critical failure, the bomb misses entirely, dealing no damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target's resistance or weakness. You don't multiply splash damage on a critical hit.</div><div><br /></div><div>For example, if you throw a lesser acid flask and hit your target, that creature takes 2 acid damage, 2d6 persistent acid damage, and 2 acid splash damage. All other creatures within 5 feet of it take 2 acid splash damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 4 acid damage and 4d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage is still 2. If you miss, the target and all creatures within 5 feet take only 2 splash damage. If you critically fail, no one takes any damage.</div></div>
