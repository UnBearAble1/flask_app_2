Choose a container of water on your person that is of light Bulk. For 1 round, if you or an ally throw this container at a foe, it has the damaging effects of <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/holy-water" target="_blank">holy water</a>. The water's transient power doesn't make it gain any value, allow it to be used to supply the cost for a spell or ritual, and so on. If you have legendary proficiency in Religion, you can sanctify three containers held by you or allies within your reach instead of one.</div></div>
