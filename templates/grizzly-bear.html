</br><h1>Grizzly Bear</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 4</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>This large and powerful omnivore inhabits forested hills. While it typically sustains itself on nuts, berries, fish, and small mammals, it's fiercely territorial and will chase off or kill any creature it views as competition. Grizzly bears are especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly bear often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues its assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear is hungry, it will not hesitate to feed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Animal (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Large, Animal, Brute</strong></div><div>Perception +7; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet</div><div>Skills Athletics +8, Survival +5</div><div>Str +4, Dex +1, Con +5, Int -4, Wis +1, Cha -2</div><div><strong>AC 17; Fort +9, Ref +5, Will +7</strong></div><div><strong>HP 70</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 35 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features:</br></strong></div><div>Mauler The grizzly bear gains a +2 circumstance bonus to damage rolls against creatures it has grabbed.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Jaws: Melee Single Action; </br>+7 [+2/-3], Damage 2d8+4 piercing</li>  <li>Claws: Melee Single Action; </br>+7 [+3/-1] (agile), Damage 2d6+4 slashing plus <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//grab-monster-ability" target="_blank">Grab</a></li>  <li>Rush; Two Actions; The grizzly bear <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//stride" target="_blank">Strides</a> and makes a Strike at the end of that movement.
