When the ally you chose for Courageous Assault critically succeeds at the Strike granted by that action, another ally affected by your <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/inspire-courage" target="_blank">inspire courage</a> composition spell can immediately use a reaction to make a melee Strike. Since the second ally wasn't the ally you chose for Courageous Assault, this effect doesn't continue to a third ally, even if the second ally also critically succeeds at their Strike.</div></div>
