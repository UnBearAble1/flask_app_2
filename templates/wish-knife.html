Wish knives are lighter than their counterparts, making them the weapon of choice for agile combatants.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is -4 instead of -5, and -8 instead of -10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Disarm:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon.

This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.</div></div>
