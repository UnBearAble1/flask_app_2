When an alignment ampoule strikes a creature with a weakness to good, evil, chaos, or law, it deals the listed damage, which matches the creature's highest weakness. This damage is always based on the weaknesses of the initial target of the attack. If a creature has multiple eligible weaknesses, randomly determine the damage type. An alignment ampoule has no effect against creatures that don't have a weakness to the ampoule's associated alignment types.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>TRAINED:</br></strong></div><div><strong>Cost: </strong>5 gold</br></div><div>The bomb deals 2d4 damage and 2 splash damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>EXPERT:</strong></div><div><strong>Cost: </strong>20 gold</div><div>The bomb deals 3d4 damage and 3 splash damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>MASTER:</strong></div><div><strong>Cost: </strong>50 gold</div><div>The bomb deals 4d4 damage and 4 splash damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LEGENDARY:</strong></div><div><strong>Cost: </strong>85 gold</div><div>The bomb deals 5d4 damage and 5 splash damage.</div></div>
