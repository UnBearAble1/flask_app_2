This must be obvious to anyone who would see you, possibly due to something like a tattoo or brand, or a magical mark. It could also be your manner or voice, but it also must be readily apparent.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>A Social Stigma gives you a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/all-about-complications" target="_blank">reaction penalty</a>, restricts your social mobility, or both. Examples include:</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Criminal Record: [-1 pts] </strong>You have been convicted of a serious crime, and branded so. You may be prohibited from owning weapons, taking certain jobs, or traveling outside of your country. Many noncriminals have <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/all-about-complications" target="_blank">a -1 reaction penalty</a>, and those in legal positions (or vigilantes) have a -2.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Excommunicated: [-1 pts]</strong> You have been kicked out of your church, and it happens to be a large and prolific church in the game setting. Clergy and other relevant religious types react to you at -3. Your aura has also been marked, and it is readily apparent to anyone with divine spell-power or is of a celestial nature.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Minor: [-1 pt]</strong> You are underage by your culture's standards. You suffer -2 on reaction rolls whenever you try to deal with others as an adult; they might like you, but they do not fully respect you. You might also be barred from bars, vehicle operation, war parties, guild membership, etc., depending on the culture and setting. You must buy off this trait when you reach "legal age" (usually 18) for your time and place.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Monster: [-3 pts]</strong> You are a large carnivore, magical abomination, or other being that is hated or feared regardless of actual appearance or disposition. This gives you -3 on all reaction rolls, and you are liable to be hunted on sight. However, you get +3 to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/intimidation-chr" target="_blank">Intimidation</a> rolls in situations where you have the upper hand (GM's opinion). Examples: a bear or a vampire.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Outcast: [-2 pts] </strong>You belong to a group that most of the setting's society view as suspicious or lesser than, such as in most settings, the Drow. You get -2 to reaction rolls with most people.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
