Any creature moving on the land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This vine has a 15-foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target; on a success, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//immobilized" target="_blank">immobilized</a> for 1 round or until the creature Escapes (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.</div></div>
