</br><h1>Flat-Footed</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>You're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others--especially conditions--can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."</div><div><br /></div><div>Flat-Footed, like other conditions, can have a number associated with it indicating how distracted you are. The first time you are impacted by the Flat-Footed condition, you are simply Flat-Footed (or -2 to AC.) If a second effect would cause you to become Flat-Footed, you become Flat-Footed 3, and that increases by 1 for each additional effect that causes Flat-Footed. The number is the circumstance penalty to AC.</br></div></div>
