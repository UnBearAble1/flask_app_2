You have to indulge in your habit once per day, at least, and if you run into a situation where it would be easy to do so beyond that you will need to make a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//all-about-complications" target="_blank">self control roll</a> to resist doing so. Even if you make this roll, you suffer from the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//bad-temper" target="_blank">Bad Temper</a> complication the whole time you are within the presence of the thing you are avoiding, with the same self control roll as your compulsive behavior. The point value of this complication is based on how much trouble you are likely to get into with it. Here are some examples, but the DM has final say:</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Compulsive Carousing: [-1 pts]</br></strong></div><div>Once per day, you must seek out a social gathering to lounge, feast, drink, sing and joke. You must do so for at least an hour. This may mean that you even crash the party, if you're not invited. You will spend your money frivolously, you will try almost any mind altering substance, won't refuse drinks, and aren't picky about your romantic partners. You get +1 to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//diplomacy-chr" target="_blank">diplomacy</a> and <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//deception-chr" target="_blank">deception</a> against like-minded extroverts, but -1 or worse for more sober citizens.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Compulsive Gambling: [-1 pts]</br></strong></div><div>You have a hard time passing up opportunities to gamble. These can be full games of chance, or simple bets and wagers or lotteries. If there is no game of chance or bet happening, you will find a way to start one, and will try and gambling game proposed to you. If you are prevented from gambling, you will quickly earn a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//all-about-complications" target="_blank">-1 to reaction rolls</a> with people in your company due to your constant talk about gambling and attempts to get others to wager with you.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Compulsive Generosity: [-1 pt]</br></strong></div><div>You are too easy to give away your money. You give when beggars ask, and always listen to requests for financial support if they are even remotely plausible. You have to make a self-control roll when hearing a good hard-luck story (and apologize way too much if you are too broke to help.) The good news is that you may earn +1 to diplomacy checks with other pious people.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Compulsive Lying: [-3 pts]</br></strong></div><div>You lie constantly, and take special delight in concocting stories about your deeds or your history, or anything else that can impress others. Even when exposed as a liar, digging in and getting angry while you still stick to your stories. Whenever you must tell the simple, unvarnished truth, you will have to make a self-control roll (if to fellow PCs, only viewable to you or the DM, so the other players don't know the result) or lie.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Compulsive Spending: [-1 pts]</br></strong></div><div>Maybe because you enjoy being seen as a big spender, or maybe you just find the experience of spending or luxury delightful. You have to make a self control roll whenever someone tries to sell you something or bargain with you with something that matches your interests, and you have at least twice the asking price in cash. Otherwise you take their deal. You take a -1 penalty to any rolls to haggle, with an additional -1 per any increases in your self control number.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Compulsive Vowing: [-1 pts]</br></strong></div><div>You constantly swear oaths. Make a self control roll to avoid swearing a vow or oath to someone when you tell them you are going to do something. These vows are often trivial, but you approach them with the same solemnity and dedication of actual sworn oaths.</br></div><div><br /></div></div>
