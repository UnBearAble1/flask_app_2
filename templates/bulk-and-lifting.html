</br><h1>Bulk and Lifting</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Your character's Bulk Limit determines how much weight they can comfortably carry. If they're carrying a total amount of Bulk Limit they are <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/encumbered" target="_blank">encumbered</a>. A character can't carry a total amount of Bulk that exceeds double their Bulk Limit. The Bulk your character is carrying equals the sum of all of their items; keep in mind that 10 light items make up 1 Bulk.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>A character's Bulk Limit is 5 + their STR modifier, with a divider or multiplier based on their size:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Tiny: divided by 4 (round up to the nearest 10th, decimals allowing L weight items)</br></li>  <li>Small: divided by 2 (round up to the nearest 10th, decimals allowing L weight items)</br></li>  <li>Medium: multiplied by 1</li>  <li>Large: multiplied by 4</li>  <li>Huge: multiplied by 10</li>  <li>Gargantuan: multiplied by 20</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><em>Example: </br>A tiny creature with a STR mod of +4 has a Bulk Limit of 2.3 (5+4 = 9 base, divided by 4 for size is 2.25, rounded up- they could carry 2B and 3L worth of items), where as a huge creature with a STR mod of +2 has a Bulk Limit of 28 (5+2 = 7 base, multiplied by 4 for size).</br></em></div><div><br /></div><div>The same multiplier above are also used for appropriate sized equipment. A pixie's longsword would be 1/4th the bulk of a human's (3L) where as a huge plague giant's longsword would be 10x the bulk (10B).</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Maximum LIft:</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>A creature can lift 15kg per point of Bulk Limit they have.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><em>Example: </br>human with a +1 strength (above average) can lift 90 kg (198 lbs,) where as an Adult Green Dragon with a strength of +6 can lift 1,650 kg (3,670 lbs.)</br></em></div><div><br /></div><div>Using the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/power-lift" target="_blank">Power Lift</a> Athletics action can potentially double this number.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
