As usual, your ally must use the new result, even if it's worse than their first roll. If you have <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//guiding-luck" target="_blank">Guiding Luck</a>, you can't use Guiding Luck's effect that applies to attack rolls and Perception checks to use Shared Luck to benefit an ally.</div></div>
