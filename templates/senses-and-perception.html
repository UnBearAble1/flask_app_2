The GM rolls a secret Perception check; on a success, you learn that the food or drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used.

Hearing is an imprecise sense--it cannot detect the full range of detail that a precise sense can. You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense, but it has the hidden condition instead of the observed condition. It might be undetected by you if it's using Stealth or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the Seek basic action to detect the creature. At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an undetected creature (or one you didn't even know was there) merely hidden--it can't make the creature observed.</div><ul></br>  <li>Tremorsense: You can feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. Tremorsense functions only if the detecting creature is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface. A creature that moves more than 5 feet per action, or one that casts a spell or makes an attack while on the same ground, can be picked up by the sense. (Mod: 10)</br></li>  <li>Scent: You can use your sense of smell to determine the exact location of a creature. The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind. (Mod: 8)</br></li>  <li>Spiritsense: You can sense the spirits of creatures, including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and haunts within the listed range. It can't detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses, it doesn't penetrate through solid objects. (Base: 8, Mod +8)</br></li>  <li>Magic Sense: You can detect magic in the area, and the tradition and sphere of magic for the highest-tier effect within range that you detect. </br>If multiple effects are equally strong, the GM determines which you learn. As an imprecise sense, you can narrow the magic down to a five foot area. </br>(Base: 4, Mod +3)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Penetrating Vision </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><strong><br /></br>[Base: 16, Mod +8]<br /></br></strong></div><div>You gain the ability to see through matter.

(Mod +10)</br></li>  <li>Scrying: Instead of picking an area to sense remotely, you put a sensor directly above a specific creature (They get a Will Save)- where it remains static as it was formed.</br> You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, scrying's DC is 2 higher, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 higher.

The range of this only applies to activating this effect and engaging with the other creature. Once active, the projection has no range limit.</br><br /></br></div><div>When you activate this ability, the other creature can perceive anything you perceive in addition to their own senses. If a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn't otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient's vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.<br /></br></div><div>Senses:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Sight (Base: 12, Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>Hearing (Base: 8, Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>All Senses (Base: 12, Mod +18)<br /></br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Tracking</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Track Through Air and Water</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Base: 8]</br></strong></div><div><strong>Linked Skill: Survival</br></strong></div><div>You can Track through both air and water, and notice aerial or aquatic "tracks" of all creatures who passed nearby in the last hour</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Prolonged Tracking</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Base: 4]</strong></div><div><strong>Linked Skill: Survival</strong></div><div>You don't need to attempt a new Survival check every hour while Tracking.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Vague Sense</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br><strong>Default Range: 30 feet.</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You have a special vague sense. A vague sense is similar to a human's sense of smell, usually providing some sensation like a tingling on your skin or a heightened sense of anxiety. When in proximity to the subject of your senses, typically 30 feet, you eventually sense their presence, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint their location. You must make perception checks against any creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence.
