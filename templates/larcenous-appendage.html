You can use it to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//steal" target="_blank">Steal </a>an object, though it still can't hold onto it at the end of your action. If you have a hand free, you can transfer the stolen object to your hand. Otherwise, your appendage surreptitiously drops it on the ground in your space, where you can grab it later. Observers other than your target who haven't witnessed you stealing something with it are usually distracted, meaning the GM will usually decrease their Perception DCs, as normal for Stealing something.</div></div>
