</br><h1>Disrupting Actions</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Various abilities and conditions, can disrupt an action. When an action is disrupted, you still use the actions or reactions you committed and you still expend any costs, but the action's effects don't occur. In the case of an activity, you usually lose all actions spent for the activity up through the end of that turn. For instance, if you began a Cast a Spell activity requiring 3 actions and the first action was disrupted, you lose all 3 actions that you committed to that activity.<br /></br><br /></br>The GM decides what effects a disruption causes beyond simply negating the effects that would have occurred from the disrupted action. For instance, a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//leap" target="_blank">Leap</a> disrupted midway wouldn't transport you back to the start of your jump, and a disrupted item hand off might cause the item to fall to the ground instead of staying in the hand of the creature who was trying to give it away.</div></div>
