</br><h1>Earn Income</h1></br><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="2">Downtime</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>You can use a skill--typically <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/crafting" target="_blank">Crafting</a>, Lore, or Performance--to earn money during downtime. You must be trained in the skill to do so. This takes time to set up, and your income depends on your proficiency rank and how lucrative a task you can find. Because this process requires a significant amount of time and involves tracking things outside the progress of adventures, it won't come up in every campaign.</div><div><br /></div><div>In some cases, the GM might let you use a different skill to Earn Income through specialized work. Usually, this is scholarly work, such as using Religion in a monastery to study old texts--but giving sermons at a church would still fall under Performance instead of Religion. You also might be able to use physical skills to make money, such as using Acrobatics to perform feats in a circus or Thievery to pick pockets. If you're using a skill other than Crafting, Lore, or Performance, treat jobs as one level higher for the purpose of difficulty, but not pay.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this takes time and requires using the Diplomacy skill to Gather Information, doing some research, or socializing.</div><div><br /></div><div>When you take on a job, the GM secretly sets the DC of your skill check. After your first day of work, you roll to determine your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your result, the task's level, and your proficiency rank (see the chart below.)</br></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Critical Success</strong> You do outstanding work. Gain the amount of currency listed for a critical success for the proficiency requirement.</br></li>  <li><strong>Success</strong> You do competent work. Gain the amount of currency listed for a success for the proficiency requirement.</br></li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> You do shoddy work and get paid the bare minimum for your time. Gain the amount of currency listed in the failure column for the proficiency requirement. The GM will likely reduce how long you can continue at the task.</li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure </strong>You earn nothing for your work and are fired immediately. You can't continue at the task. Your reputation suffers, potentially making it difficult for you to find rewarding jobs in that community in the future.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>You can continue working at the task on subsequent days without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after the first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until the task's completion. The GM determines how long you can work at the task. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can take months or even years.</div></div><div data-component-type="table"><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th><div>Task Level</div></th><th><div>Failure</div></th><th><div>Success</div></th><th><div>Critical</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>Trained</div></td><td><div>7 sp</br></div></td><td><div>4 gp</div></td><td><div>7 gp</br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Expert</div></td><td><div>1 gp, 1 sp</br></div></td><td><div>7 gp</div></td><td><div>10 gp</br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Master</div></td><td><div>1 gp, 6 sp</div></td><td><div>10 gp</br></div></td><td><div>13 gp</br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Legendary</div></td><td><div>2 gp, 2 sp</br></div></td><td><div>13 gp</br></div></td><td><div>16 gp</br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Sample Earn Income Tasks</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>These examples use <em>Alcohol Lore</em> to work in a bar or <em>Legal Lore</em> to perform legal work.</div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Trained</strong> bartend, do legal research</li>  <li><strong>Expert</strong> curate drink selection, present minor court cases</li>  <li><strong>Master</strong> run a large brewery, present important court cases</li>  <li><strong>Legendary</strong> run an international brewing franchise, present a case in Hell's courts</li></ul></div>
