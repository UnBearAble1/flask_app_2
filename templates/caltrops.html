You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action.

A creature taking persistent bleed damage from caltrops takes a -5-foot penalty to its Speed. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe.<br /></br><br /></br>Deployed caltrops can be salvaged and reused if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough caltrops are ruined that they can't be salvaged.</div></div>
