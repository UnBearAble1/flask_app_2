When most creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they die and are removed from play unless the attack was nonlethal, in which case they are instead knocked out for a significant amount of time (usually 1 minute or more). When undead and construct creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they are destroyed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Player characters, their companions, and other significant characters and creatures don't automatically die when they reach 0 Hit Points. Instead, they are knocked out and are at risk of death. At the GM's discretion, villains, powerful monsters, special NPCs, and enemies with special abilities that are likely to bring them back to the fight (like ferocity, regeneration, or healing magic) can use these rules as well.</div><div><br /></div><div>As a player character, when you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you're knocked out with the following effects:</div><ul></br>  <li>You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.</li>  <li>You gain the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//dying" target="_blank">dying</a> condition at a value equal to your number of <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//wound-thresholds-and-healing" target="_blank">Serious or Grievous</a> wounds. </br>If you have the doomed condition, increase your dying value by an amount equal to your doomed value. If the damage was dealt by a nonlethal attack or nonlethal effect, you don't gain the dying condition; you are instead unconscious with 0 Hit Points.</li></ul></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="taking-damage-while-dying" level="4">Taking Damage While Dying</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>If you take damage while you already have the dying condition, increase your dying condition value by 1, or by 2 if the damage came from an attacker's critical hit or your own critical failure. If you have the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//wounded" target="_blank">wounded</a> condition, remember to add the value of your wounded condition to your dying value.</div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="recovery-checks" level="4">Recovery Checks</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>When you're dying, at the start of each of your turns, you must attempt a flat check with a DC equal to 10 + your current dying value to see if you get better or worse. This is called a recovery check. The effects of this check are as follows.</div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your dying value is reduced by 2.</li>  <li><strong>Success</strong> Your dying value is reduced by 1.</li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> Your dying value increases by 1.</li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your dying value increases by 2.</li></ul></div>
