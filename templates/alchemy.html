</br><h1>Alchemy</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Alchemy is the practice of pulling together ingredients from the world, infusing them with some of your own magical essence, and creating short lived alchemical items much more quickly than using traditional crafting techniques. In order to do this, Alchemists carry with them a satchel of ingredients. This item is Bulk 5L, and they can constantly refill it as they adventure by pulling in natural ingredients, strange curios, or items with emotional residue that still hold enough power. </br>It is assumed that they are always refilling this satchel without needing to specify they are doing so.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>In order to create alchemical items, the Alchemist must know the Alchemical Formula for the item. These are purchased just like normal abilities, but at 1/10th the cost. The act of creating these items is known as Quick Alchemy, and uses the following rules:</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="quick-alchemy-checks" level="4">Quick Alchemy Checks</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Quick Alchemy (In combat: 1 Action, Out of combat: 10 minutes):</strong> You make a check against the DC of the Alchemical Item (see below) to see if you can craft an item. This takes 1 action.</br><br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success:</br> You create two of the item. They must be activated by the end of your next turn, or they become inert.</br></li>  <li>Success: You create one of the item. It must be activated by the end of your next turn, or it becomes inert.</br></li>  <li>Failure: You fail to create the item, and are at a cumulative -1 to try again until you get a result other than Failure. You can reset this penalty by spending  1/4  the Complexity value in hours re-sorting your components and recalculating your formulas. The penalty also goes away during your next daily preparations. Hybrid Alchemists are at a cumulative -2 instead.</br></li>  <li>Critical Failure: You cannot create this item until you spend a number of hours equal to the Complexity value gathering components and recalculating your formulas. This time can be distributed out over multiple days if needed.</br> Hybrid Alchemists must spend double this time.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>By spending more time or mixing in special components, you can gain bonuses to your Quick Alchemy roll:<br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Extra Actions (Encounter mode):</br> Two Actions (+2);</br> Three Actions (+4)</br></li>  <li>Extra Time (Exploration mode): +2 if you spend an hour</li>  <li>Extra Time (Exploration mode): +3 if you spend six hours</li>  <li>Extra Time (Exploration mode): +4 if you spend twenty four hours</br></li>  <li>Special Components (Story based): Provide up to +3 for unique components</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></br>The DC to create an item is based on its Tier, as is its Complexity Value (which you will learn about in the Advanced Alchemy section below.)</br></div></div><div data-component-type="table"><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th><div>Tier</div></th><th><div>DC</div></th><th><div>Complexity</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>F</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>1/2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>D</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>C</div></td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>B</div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>A</div></td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>S</div></td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="advanced-alchemy" level="4">Advanced Alchemy</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>During your Daily Preparation, Alchemists get 20 Advanced Alchemy points (and Hybrid Alchemists get 10). These points have two uses:</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Re-rolling Quick Alchemy Checks</strong>: As a free action, you can spend from your Advanced Alchemy points to re-roll a success or a failure on the Quick Alchemy roll, or to turn a Critical Failure into a regular failure (you can't do both in a single round). The point cost to do so is equal to the Complexity rating of the formula.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Create Persistent Items:</strong> During your daily preparations, you can use your Advanced Alchemy points to make some quick alchemical items that remain potent until your NEXT daily preparations. To do so, simply declare that is what you are doing, and make a roll as normal. Any of these items you have successfully crafted reduces your total AA points by the complexity value.</div><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="creating-alchemical-formulas" level="4">Creating Alchemical Formulas</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Alchemical Item Formulas are essentially designed like Abilities, only they cost 1/10th the Creation Points. The highest Tier effect, perimeter, or boost you have on the ability becomes the Tier of the Formula (used to determine its DC and Complexity), but the fact that it's an Alchemical Formula actually pays the Tier cost of that single item (you don't need a matching limit.) You do, however, need to match any remaining Tiers of the ability with corresponding limits as normal. Once your character knows the formula, they can use Quick Alchemy to actually craft them. They can also use traditional crafting to make much longer lasting items.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Alchemical Items (once brought into existence by crafting or Quick Alchemy) are physical items that can be used by others, and are therefore incompatible with "Is Item" limit, as that is already cooked in. Once crafted, the item appears in an empty hand of the Alchemist. The action to create them with Quick Alchemy does not include the action to use them, which must be done separately.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Because of how they are activated, they cannot have other activation limits or boosts (meaning you cannot change the speed in which you use Quick Alchemy) - but you can modify the speed in which the item itself is activated using limits or boosts.</br>All Alchemical Items take 1 action to activate, even if normally their default activation time is longer.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Effects with no Tier:</br> When selecting an effect with no Tier, use the effect's base cost to determine its Tier for purposes of creating a Prepared Alchemical Ability out of it:</div><ul></br>  <li>F: 1-49</li>  <li>D: 50-89</li>  <li>C: 90-149</li>  <li>B: 150-199</li>  <li>A: 200+</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>When building Formulas, they must be made to fit one of the following themes:</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Bombs</strong>: Bombs are thrown, so must include a range between 30 to 120 feet. Once they detonate, they could have a different range or area of effect, but should be single targets with splash damage, or explode into an area afterward. They cannot be configured to make judgements, so cannot differentiate friend from foe.</br></div><div><br /></br></div><div><strong>Ignitions</strong>: Ignitions are small cone effects, typically made by tossing out two substances that interact violently into an alchemical reaction. They are special attacks with a cone area of effect no larger than 20 feet.</br></div><div><br /></br></div><div><strong>Poisons</strong>: Poisons are special attacks with the "Affliction" modifier. To create injury poisons, make sure to select the "Includes Strike" option. Inhaled poisons are special attacks with the "inhaled" limit - they can have an area of no larger than 15 feet. Contact poisons must also have the "trap" boost.</br></div><div><br /></br></div><div><strong>Elixirs</strong>: Elixirs can have almost any effect, as long as the effect is limited only to a single person (which is the consumer). They must be ingested. The effect cannot directly augment the outside world beyond the consumer, nor grant them abilities that allow them to augment the outside world (or teleport through it, etc.) They are modifications to the person themself.</br></div><div><br /></br></div><div><strong>Tools</strong>: Tools have a range of touch, and can alter materials in the world. The general guideline for a tool is that it must interact with the physical world, and more or less replicate the types of things modern technology can do. They cannot be weapons nor defensive tools, only utility. Tools cannot have effects more potent than Tier B.</br> Example tools are those that generate light, ignite flammable objects, douse fires, glue things together, dissolve matter, or the like.</br></div></div>
