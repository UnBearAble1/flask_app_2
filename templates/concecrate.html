While within the area, worshippers of your deity gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and Perception checks, and creatures anathema to your deity (such as undead for Pharasma or Sarenrae) take a -1 status penalty to those checks. Attacks made by worshippers of your deity within the area deal 1 damage of one of your deity's alignment types (your choice); if your deity is true neutral, you don't gain this benefit.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success- The consecration succeeds, and it either lasts for 10 years instead of 1 or covers an area with twice the radius. Occasionally, with your deity's favor, this might produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.</li>  <li>Success- The consecration succeeds.</li>  <li>Failure- The consecration fails.</li>  <li>Critical Failure- The consecration fails spectacularly and angers your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure.

The cost increases to 500 gold.</br></div></div>
