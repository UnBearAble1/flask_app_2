When throwing an alchemical bomb with the</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//splash" target="_blank">splash</a></br>trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the target's space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes up more than a single square, the target's square closest to you is the first affected square of the cone. If you have the Greater Splash boost, this cone becomes a 20-foot cone.</br></div></div>
