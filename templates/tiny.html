</br><h1>Tiny</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>5 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Physiology; Small Stature</strong></div><div>PCs are typically Small or Medium size, but you are Tiny instead! Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space and reach: </br></div><ul></br>  <li>You can enter another creature's space, which is important because your melee Strikes typically have no reach, meaning you must enter their space to attack them. Like other Tiny creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/take-cover" target="_blank">Take Cover</a>.</br></li>  <li>You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a reach 5 feet shorter than normal if they have the reach trait). Remember to adjust the Bulk of items and your Bulk limit for Tiny size, as well as your <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/bulk-and-lifting" target="_blank">lifting capacity.</br></a></li>  <li>Your movement speeds are halved, as it takes you longer to traverse distanced due to your size.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+3 Points)</strong> Evanescent Wings: You've manifested wings that can flutter for brief spurts. You don't need to spend any additional actions to reach something in your space that a Medium creature could reach. For instance, if you wanted to open a cookie jar located four feet off the ground, you only need to spend a single Interact action to do so. When you use Evanescent Wings to flutter to a higher place in your space, your action gains the move trait. Your wings are considered</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/winglets" target="_blank">winglets</a></br>for the purposes of prerequisites for other wing feats, AND your speed is considered 30 for determining those flight speeds.</br></div></div>
