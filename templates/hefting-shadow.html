</br><h1>Hefting Shadow</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>3 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Natural Abilities; Shadows</strong></div><div><strong>Conjuration, Occult, Shadow</strong><br /></br>Your shadow can contain objects. You can Interact with your shadow to store or retrieve objects, just like you would a mundane container (meaning you spend two Interact actions total to store and then retrieve the object, for example). Your shadow can contain 2 Bulk of objects, which don't count toward the Bulk you're carrying. The items remain solid but take on a shadowy patina while stored this way. Though the items are in your shadow and can be detected normally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/conceal-an-object" target="_blank">Conceal the Objects</a> unless someone knows to check your shadow for items.</div></div>
