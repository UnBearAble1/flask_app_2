</br><h1>Recover Spell</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>5 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Spellcaster; Metamagic</strong></div><div><strong>1 Action; Concentate, Metamagic; Requirements An enemy's action disrupted your attempts to Cast a Spell since the beginning of your last turn.</strong><br /></br>You recover the energy of a recently disrupted spell, allowing you to cast it again as long as you do so immediately before the energy dissipates. You regain the use of a spell that was disrupted since the beginning of your last turn, but you must immediately Cast the Spell again with your next action (no roll required) or else you lose the spell; as normal for metamagic, this must be on the same turn that you use Recover Spell. You can change the area, targets, and other variables, including the number of actions used to Cast the Spell if the spell allows, such as when casting heal or magic missile.</div></div>
