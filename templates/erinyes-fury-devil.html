</br><h1>Erinyes (Fury Devil)</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature's crimes, torturing and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the first erinyes shared that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of torturers and persecutors. The erinyes' origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a fallen angel and one of Hell's most powerful demigods. The first erinyes were all considered to be Eiseth's metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that time are no longer limited to a single gender.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Recall Knowledge - Fiend (Religion)</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LE, Medium, Devil, Fiend, Artillery</br></strong></div><div>Perception +11; greater darkvision, true seeing</div><div>Languages Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal; telepathy 100 feet</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +12, Crafting +6, Deception +11, Diplomacy +7, Intimidation +11, Religion +8, Stealth +9</div><div>Str +5, Dex +5, Con +5, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +5</div><div><strong>AC 18; Fort +7, Ref +11, Will +9; +1 status to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 48; Immunities fire ; Resistances physical 5 (except silver), poison 10 ; Weaknesses good 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet, fly 40 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Flaming Longsword; Melee Single Action: </br>+9 (+4 / -1) (evil, fire, magical, versatile P), Damage 2d6+6 slashing plus 1d6 evil and 1d6 fire</li>  <li>Flaming composite longbow; Ranged Single Action: +11 (+6 /+1) </br>(deadly 1d10, evil, fire, magical, range increment 100 feet, reload 0, volley 30 feet), Damage 2d8+6 piercing plus 1d6 evil and 1d6 fire</li>  <li>Rope; Ranged Single Action: +11 [+6/+1] (magical, range increment 30 feet), Effect rope snare</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Rope Snare An erinys carries a coil of rope woven of their hair (use the statistics for rope) that animates in their hands. When a creature is hit by the erinys's rope, a segment of the rope tears loose and wraps itself around the creature, imposing a 10-foot circumstance penalty to Speed. The piece that tears off is 10 feet long for a Medium or smaller creature, and doubles in length for each size larger than Medium. When a creature <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/escape" target="_blank">Escapes </a>the effect (DC 20), the detached segment of rope withers away into useless black sludge.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Divine Innate Spells DC 18</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Master: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/dimension-door" target="_blank">dimension door</a>;</br></li>      <li>Expert: dimension door (at will),<a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/divine-wrath" target="_blank"> divine wrath</a>,<a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/pain-domain-retributive-pain" target="_blank"> retributive pain</a>; <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/fear-8000793" target="_blank">fear </a>(at will);</br></li>      <li>Trained:<a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/illusory-disguise" target="_blank"> illusory disguise</a> (at will),<a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/illusory-object" target="_blank"> illusory object</a>;</br></li>      <li>Constant (Master)<a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/true-seeing" target="_blank"> true seeing</a></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Furious Fusillade; Three Actions: The erinys hovers in place if they are flying and fires one arrow at any number of creatures in a 30-foot cone.
