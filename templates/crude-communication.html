</br><h1>Crude Communication</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>3 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Society; Languages</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: Expert in Society</strong><br /></br>Even if you don't speak a creature's language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning. If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret Society check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity. On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts. If you're legendary in Society, you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate (without having to spend the 10 minutes).</br></div></div>
