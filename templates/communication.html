The default duration of the memory transferred is 10 minutes, which can be modified with limits and boosts.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The memory can instead be transferred into an item, which can be activated by others with an interactive action. The default duration the item contains the memory is 24 hours, which can also be changed with limits and boosts.

This effect requires the creature to be willing to try and communicate with you.<br /></br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Read Lips</strong></div><div><strong>[Base: 1]</br></strong></div><div>You can read the lips of others nearby who you can clearly see.<br /></br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Universal Language</strong></div><div><strong>[Base: 8, Mod +2]</strong></div><div><strong>[Auditory]</br></strong></div><div>Everyone listening to you hears your words as if you were speaking in their own language (though you do not actually speak that language, nor does this ability allow you to understand any additional languages)</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Linguistic Effects </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Linguistic Effect Translation</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Base: 2]</br></strong></div><div><strong>Activation: instantaneous</strong></div><div><strong>Default action: reaction, Default range: 30 feet.</br></strong></div><div>You can make a creature applicable to a linguistic effect even if they don't speak the language.<br /></br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Perfect Phonetics</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Mod: 1]</strong></div><div>You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with this ability or that speaks the language to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them.</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Non Sapient Dialogue </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>[Auditory]</br></strong></div><div>You can verbally communicate with objects or creatures that normally cannot be communicated with in such a fashion. Unless the creature is specifically being commanded or trained to be hostile, this typically includes the benefit that creatures of the type indicated will give you time to make your case. Depending on the degree of sapience and intelligence of the target, the responses you get from this communication may be incredibly monosyllabic, slow, stupid or unhelpful.<br /></br><br /></br>(Base: 8) </br></div><ul></br>  <li>Animated Constructs</br></li></ul><div><br /></br>(Base: 12)</br></div><ul></br>  <li>A narrow category of inanimate objects, such as stone or all weapons. For purposes of this communication, these objects are assumed to have vague and imprecise senses out to 30 feet, or precise senses regarding any creature carrying or wielding them.</br></li>  <li>Mindless Undead</br></li>  <li>A narrow type of animals or beasts, such as oozes, cats, canines, bovines, burrowing creatures, rodents, or flying insects.</li></ul><div><br /></br>(Base: 16, Mod +4)</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Plants.</br> For purposes of this communication, most plants are assumed to have vague and imprecise senses out to 30 feet, or precise senses regarding any creature touching them.</br></br></li>  <li>All Animals</br><br /></br></li></ul><div>Special Modification:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Instead of full dialogue and discourse, you are only able to communicate vague senses of security and requests. This will allow you to use the Diplomacy skill on the target, but not get back detailed information (though the target may be able to roughly indicate some things.) (Mod -8)</br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Telepathy </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Activation: Duration</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Mental]</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You can communicate telepathically with sapient creatures. The communication is two-way, though you can only communicate with willing creatures that share a language with you. This ability has the Mental and Linguistic trait.</br>The base price is based on the range, and like all ranged abilities, you must be able to see your target the first time you use this ability on them. Any time after the first successful use, however, they must simply be in range.</br></div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Your range is touch. [Base: 8, </br>Mod -4]</br></li>  <li>Your range is 30 feet [Base: 8]</br></li>  <li>Your range is 120 feet [Base: 12, Mod -4]</li>  <li>Your range is 500 feet [Base 12]</br></li>  <li>Your range is planetary [Base: 16, Mod +8]</br></li>  <li>Your range is anywhere [Base: 20, Mod +14] <br /></br></li></ul><div>Note: If it makes sense, you can purchase the reduced range limit for either the initial activation range, or the range recipients can stay within. This means you could have telepathy ability that can be activated within 30 feet, but your recipients can then wander within 500 feet and still communicate, for example.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Any ten minutes of interaction with the target counts as your initial activation of this ability, allowing any following activations to not require line of sight. (Mod +3)</br></li>  <li>This ability loses the "Linguistic" trait, and language is no longer a barrier. [Base +4, Mod +20]</br></li>  <li>Telepathic Hub: You can link multiple targets into a group chat. All applicable targets are linked with a single activation. (Base: +4, Mod +12)</br></li>  <li>Your recipient cannot communicate back to you (Base -4, Mod -4)</br></li>  <li>Dream Council: You can alter your telepathy to create a shared dream space, allowing all the applicable recipients to communicate as if they are in the same room. Sleeping targets can still choose to join this dreamspace, and when you use this effect, all others you target that aren't currently asleep can choose to immediately fall asleep and enter.</br> (Mod +6)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Dream Council Only (as above, but this is the only way you can use your Telepathy). (Base -4, Mod -6 </br>instead of Mod +6)</br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Remote Messaging: Your telepathy is limited to a single message sent, and a single message responded. Each message may only be 25 words long. (Base -4, Mod -8)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>You must mouth the words you are sending (Mod -2)</br></li>      <li>You can only send the message into the dreams of a recipient, who receives it the next time they sleep. (Mod -4)</br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Location Messaging: Your telepathy is limited to a message sent to a location (up to a 30 foot area). Anyone entering the area feels the message is present, and can choose to hear that message by spending an interact action. By default, the message can only be up to 25 words long, and the location must be an obvious place or landmark well known to you. (Base -4, Mod -8)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>The message can be up to 5 minutes long (Mod +4)</br></li>      <li>The message is actually played out loud, for all to hear (Mod -2)</br></li>      <li>The message can only be heard once (Mod -3)</br></li>      <li>You can select the people who can perceive the effect and</br> listen to the message. (Mod +2)</br></li>      <li>The message is attached to a living animal, who carries it to the location at normal speed using normal locomotion. This could cause problems if the animal doesn't survive, or is intercepted. (Mod -7)<strong></br></strong></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Text and Script Effects</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br><strong>Perfect Text Memorization</strong></div><div><strong>[Base: 3]</br></strong></div><div>You can fully memorize text, and you don't need to understand the writing or identify the language to reproduce it later. By default, you can dedicate an unlimited amount of information to memory, but this does not let you consume the information any faster (check out Enhanced Activity Use for that benefit.)<br /></br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Magical Script</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Base: 3]</br></strong></div><div><strong>Activation: Duration</strong></div><div><strong>Default range: touch</strong></div><div>You do not need writing tools or ink to write words onto paper or similarly appropriate surfaces.</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Transmit Status</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><strong>Activation: Duration</strong></div><div><strong>[Mental]</br></strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: 1 Mile</strong><br /></br></div><div>Rather than sending communication, or memories, you transmit elements of your current state. The cost is based on how useful the information could be:</br></div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Trivial: ex Your current mood (Base: 3)</br></li>  <li>Useful: ex That you've made a decision (out of two possible decisions they are aware of), your current amount of wealth (Base: 4, Mod +1)</br></li>  <li>Critical:</br> ex Your current location, your current hit points, current conditions affecting you, etc (Base: 4, Mod +4)</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Voice Effects</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Megaphonic</strong></div><div><strong>(Base: 1)</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Auditory], Default Range: 300 feet</strong></div><div>Your Voice can be heard within range, regardless of other ambient sounds.<br /></br><br /></br></div><div><strong>True Ventriloquism</strong></div><div><strong>(Base: 8, Mod -2)</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Illusion], Linked Skill: Deception</br></strong></div><div>Default Range: 60 feet</br>(maximum boost possible 120 feet)</br></div><div>Whenever you speak or make any other sound vocally, you can make your vocalization seem to originate from somewhere else and you can change that apparent location freely as you vocalize. Creatures can still attempt to discern the location of your voice if they sense something is amiss (check versus their perception). <br /></br><br /></br></div><div><strong>True Mimicry</br></strong></div><div><strong>(Base: 4)</strong></div><div><strong>Linked Skill: Deception</strong></div><div>You can replicate sounds not normally reproduced by the human tongue, as well as perfectly mimic another person's voice after having heard them speaking for at least 1 minute.</br><br /></br></div></div></div></div>
