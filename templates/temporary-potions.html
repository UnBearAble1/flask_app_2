These items follow the normal rules to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/craft" target="_blank">Craft</a> them, except for the time they take, with some additional restrictions. They must both be the same type of elixir or drug, and they may only be trained-tier items. Any items you create this way become inert bottles of liquid the next time you make your daily preparations, and any remaining effects of the temporary items end. A temporary item has no value. If you have master proficiency in your tradition's spell DCs, you can create a batch of three temporary elixirs or drugs during your daily preparations, and if you have legendary proficiency, you can create a batch of four.</div></div>
