The flurry deals 9d6 cold damage and 9d6 slashing damage to all foes, with a basic Reflex save, but the gust flows harmlessly around your allies. The wind then picks you up and carries you to the other end of the area; though your movement within the gust can still trigger reactions, the storm of ice crystals prevents you from being affected by any effects, except for those that would <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/counteracting" target="_blank">counteract</a> the spell's magic or that the GM decides would affect snow.</div></div>
