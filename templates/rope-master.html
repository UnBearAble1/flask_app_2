When Climbing a rope, you move 5 more feet on a success and 10 more feet on a critical success, to a maximum of your Speed. This additional movement stacks with other feats that increase climbing speed on successful checks (but not with Climb Speeds.)</br></div><div><br /></div><div></br>In addition, you can use a rope to hamper your foes. When holding a rope, you can attempt an Athletics check to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/disarm" target="_blank">Disarm</a>, <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/grapple" target="_blank">Grapple</a>, or <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/trip" target="_blank">Trip</a> a creature up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. If you critically fail such a check while holding a rope, you can drop the rope to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div></div>
