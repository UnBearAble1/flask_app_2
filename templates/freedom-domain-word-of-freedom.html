</br><h1>Freedom Domain: Word of Freedom</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>3 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Acrobatics; Remove Conditions</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: Master in Acrobatics; Trained in Religion</strong><br /></br>You liberate yourself and others from shackles and constraints. You gain the following <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//focus-spells" target="_blank">Focus Spell,</a> and increase your Focus Point Pool by 1.<br /></br><strong><br /></br>Word of Freedom; Enchantment, Mental<br /></br>1 Action verbal; Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Duration 1 round</strong><br /></br>You utter a liberating word of power that frees a creature. You suppress one of the following conditions of your choice: <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//confused" target="_blank">confused</a>, <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//frightened" target="_blank">frightened</a>, <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//grabbed" target="_blank">grabbed</a>, or <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//paralyzed" target="_blank">paralyzed</a>. The target isn't affected by the chosen condition, and if you suppress the grabbed condition, the target automatically breaks free from any grab affecting it when you Cast the Spell.<br /></br><br /></br>If you don't remove the effect that provided the condition, the condition returns after the spell ends. For example, if a spell was making the target confused for 1 minute, word of freedom would let the target act normally for a round, but the confused condition would return afterward.</div></div>
