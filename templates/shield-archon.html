</br><h1>Shield Archon</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 7</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Shield archons defend the fortresses of Heaven against fiendish incursions. They wield their spears and shields in massive formations capable of withstanding any onslaught. Beneath their armor, they are sheathed in skin of steel. Given their tremendous strength and imposing stature, shield archons are ideal guardians of the meek and are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane to ward off the attacks of great numbers of evildoers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Celestial (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LG, Large, Archon, Celestial, Soldier</br></strong></div><div>Perception +10; darkvision</div><div>Languages Celestial, Draconic, Infernal; tongues</div><div>Skills Athletics +12, Diplomacy +9, Intimidation +9, Religion +9, Survival +7</div><div><strong>Str +5, Dex +1, Con +7, Int +2, Wis +3, Cha +3</strong></div><div><strong>AC 22 (24 with shield raised) ; Fort +12 , Ref +10 , Will +8; +1 status to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 94; Weaknesses evil 10</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 30 feet, fly 60 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Living Shield: A shield archon's shield is the focal point of its courage and soul. It always has its shield raised without needing to Raise a Shield, and it can use <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//shield-block" target="_blank">Shield Block</a> as a free action instead of a reaction (Hardness 10, HP 80). A shield archon can trigger its Shield Block free action when an ally within 10 feet is the target of an attack, reducing damage to that ally instead of itself but otherwise following the normal rules of Shield Block.</li>  <li>Menacing Guardian (aura, divine, enchantment) 30 feet. Enemies that start their turn in the area or enter it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. On a failure, they take a -1 status penalty to attack rolls, spell rolls, and damage rolls against any other target while in the aura for 24 hours or until they damage the archon, whichever comes first. On a critical failure, they can't use hostile actions against any other target while in the area for 24 hours or until they damage the archon, whichever comes first. Regardless of the result, a creature is then temporarily immune to further menacing guardian auras for 24 hours.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reactions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Retributive Spear</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Trigger: An enemy damages an ally of the Shield Archon</br></li>      <li>Requirements: Both the enemy and the ally are within 10 feet of the Shield Archon</br></li>      <li>Effect: The Legion Archon makes Spear strike against the enemy</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Holy Spear; Melee Single Action: +11 (+6 /+1) (magical, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8+7 piercing plus 1d6 good</li>  <li>Divine Innate Spells DC 20;</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Master: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//dimension-door" target="_blank">dimension door</a> (at will);</br></li>      <li>Trained: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//shield-other" target="_blank">shield other</a> (x3); <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//true-strike" target="_blank">true strike</a> (x3);</br></li>      <li>Cantrips: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//message" target="_blank">message</a>;</br></li>      <li>Constant: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//tongues" target="_blank">tongues</a></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Archon's Door: Once per day, if an archon sees another creature cast dimension door, it can cast an innate dimension door (heightened to Master) within 1 round to attempt to follow that creature to the maximum distance of the archon's dimension door. If the archon's dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the same distance and direction from the creature as before either used dimension door.</li>  <li>Morphic Hands: Single Action (divine, transmutation) A shield archon's hands can change into a </br>holy spear and a shield or back into hands. Transforming does not restore any HP to the items, and if either the weapon or shield is fully destroyed, the archon loses that hand until it receives a regenerate spell or similar magic. If a shield archon is slain, its weapon and shield can be taken, but they fade into nothingness after 24 hours.</li>  <li>Courageous Switch: When a shield archon uses its dimension door innate spell, it can choose to move into the space of a willing ally it can see within range. If it does so, the ally switches places with the archon, appearing in the space the archon just vacated, as if it too had cast dimension door.</li></ul></div>
