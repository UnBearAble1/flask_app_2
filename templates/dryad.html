</br><h1>Dryad</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 4</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Dryads are fey guardians of the trees and creatures who dwell in wooded areas. They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their sacred groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to enlist the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone. In times of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.</div><div><br /></div><div>Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied to a specific tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to match their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink coloration and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature)</div><div>Recall Knowledge - Plant (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CG, Medium, Fey, Nymph, Plant, Controller</br></strong></div><div>Perception +7; low-light vision</div><div>Languages Common, Elven, Sylvan; speak with plants</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +8, Athletics +4, Crafting +4 (+9 woodworking), Diplomacy +8, Nature +7, Stealth +6, Survival +8</div><div>Str +0, Dex +4, Con +1, Int +2, Wis +3, Cha +4</div><div><strong>AC 16; Fort +5 , Ref +7 , Will +9</strong></div><div><strong>HP 24; Weaknesses cold iron 5, fire 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Nature Empathy The dryad can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and make very simple Requests of animals and plants.</li>  <li>Tree Dependent: A dryad is mystically bonded to a single great tree and must remain within 300 feet of it. If she moves beyond that range for more than two minutes, she becomes <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/sickened" target="_blank">sickened</a> 1 and is unable to recover. She must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save every hour or increase the sickened value by 1 (to a maximum of sickened 4). After 24 hours, she becomes <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/drained" target="_blank">drained</a> 1, with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours. A dryad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond herself to a new tree.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Melee Single Action branch +6 (+1 / -4) (finesse, magical), Damage 2d4+4 bludgeoning</li>  <li>Primal Innate Spells DC 19, attack +9;</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Master:<a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/tree-stride" target="_blank"> tree stride</a> (x2);</br></li>      <li>Expert: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/charm" target="_blank">charm</a> (x3), <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/suggestion" target="_blank">suggestion</a>; <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/sleep" target="_blank">sleep</a>;</br></li>      <li>Trained: </br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/entangle" target="_blank">entangle</a> (at will), <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/tree-shape" target="_blank">tree shape</a> (at will);</br></li>      <li>Cantrips: </br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/tangled-forest-rake" target="_blank">tanglefoot</a>;</br></li>      <li>Constant: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/speak-with-plants-3775319" target="_blank">speak with plants</a></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Tree Meld Two Actions (primal, transmutation) The dryad touches a tree of enough volume to contain her and merges into it for as long as she wishes. She can Cast a Spell while inside as long as the spell doesn't require a line of effect outside the tree. She can hear, but not see, what's going on outside the tree. She can Dismiss this effect.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Significant physical damage dealt to the tree expels the dryad from the tree and deals 3d6 damage to her. Passwall expels the dryad without dealing damage.</li>      <li>If a dryad uses this ability on her bonded tree, she instead enters an extradimensional living space within the tree; Tree Meld gains the extradimensional trait. A dryad can bring up to two other creatures with her when entering her home within her bonded tree. The dryad can still be expelled from this space as above.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul></div>
