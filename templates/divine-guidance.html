Spend 10 minutes <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//decipher-writing" target="_blank">Deciphering Writing</a> on religious scriptures of your deity or philosophy while thinking about a particular problem or conundrum you face, and then attempt a Religion check (DC determined by the GM). If you succeed, you unearth a relevant passage, parable, or aphorism that can help you move forward or change your thinking to help solve your conundrum. For example, the GM might provide you with a cryptic poem or hint that can guide you to the next step of solving your problem.</div></div>
