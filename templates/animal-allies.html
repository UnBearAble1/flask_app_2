</br><h1>Animal Allies</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>5 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Natural Abilities; Animal Kinsmanship</strong></div><div>A specific type of animal (such as feline, reptile, aquatic, burrowing, rodent, etc) has special cultural significance to your people -- you gain a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/familiar" target="_blank">familiar</a> of that type. Whenever you replace your familiar, it must be of this same type. Because it is a specific type of familiar, it must dedicate one of its special abilities each day to a specific feature related to the type it is. For example, if you choose owls, your familiar must always select flight as its first ability each day. Ultimately the GM is the arbitrator of what makes sense for this ability.</br></div></div>
