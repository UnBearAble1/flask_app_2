With its ingenious mixture of rare reagents, dried protoplasm harvested from ooze creatures, and a little pinch of alchemy, this snare triggers into an ooze-like hazard that temporarily mimics the dangers presented by a creature like a sewer ooze or other carnivorous protoplasmic monster. When a creature triggers a clinging ooze snare, the snare creates a short lived protoplasmic mass that lashes out in all directions, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 acid damage. The triggering creature must attempt a DC 18 Reflex save.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected</li>  <li>Success The creature takes half damage</li>  <li>Failure The target takes full damage and is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> until the start of their next turn as the ooze impedes their movement.</li>  <li>Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is both flat-footed and <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/immobilized" target="_blank">immobilized</a> for 1 round.
