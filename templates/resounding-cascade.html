You grant the extra damage of Arcane Cascade in an aura affecting all allies in a 5-foot emanation until you are no longer in the stance. </br>This uses only the base damage of the stance; it doesn't use any increase you get from bonuses, the laughing shadow hybrid study, or the like. As normal for duplicate effects, multiple Arcane Cascades affecting the same creature aren't cumulative.</div></div>
