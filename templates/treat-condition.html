If the duration is longer than a minute, you may only attempt this check once. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//counteracting" target="_blank">counteract </a>check against the condition, using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or deity unless you have <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//legendary-medic" target="_blank">Legendary Medic</a>; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a good character gains from carrying an unholy weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.</div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success Reduce the condition value by 2.</li>  <li>Success Reduce the condition value by 1.</li>  <li>Critical Failure Increase the condition value by 1.</li></ul></div>
