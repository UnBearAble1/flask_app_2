</br><h1>All About Complications</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Complications are a way to gain more points to spend on ancestry, class and skill feats at character creation. Each complication you select has a value, given as a negative number. These are the number of points you get.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="informative"><div class="info-container" info-color="green"><div class="info-content"><div><em>You can thank the GURPS roleplaying game for this feature of the game, from which most of these complications were lifted whole-cloth. Though I don't believe these elements can always be referred to as &quot;disadvantages,&quot; they can certainly complicate someone's life.</br></em></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="selecting-complications" level="4">Selecting Complications</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>You can select up to 15 points of complications, up to 5 which represent your Ancestry (and thus give you up to 5 points to spend on Ancestry feats) and up to 10 which represent your background (and thus give you up to 10 points to spend on Class and Skill feats). </br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="contradictory-feats" level="4">Contradictory Feats</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Some feats indicate particular abilities that are naturally counterintuitive to your complication. For example, the Absent Minded complication (which makes you often unprepared) and the Prescient Planner feat (which implies you are incredibly prepared). Typically you are unable to purchase feats that conflict with your complications in this way, though you may work with your DM for special exceptions.</div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="curing-complications" level="4">&quot;Curing&quot; Complications</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>No amount of magic or science can remove your complications, UNLESS you spend the points to buy them off (which cost as much as they are worth.) You cannot short-cut this cost with in game solutions, even if they make sense to do so. If there is ever a case where this becomes incredibly illogical, the onus is on you to explain why the cure doesn't work... in a world full of magic, this should be relatively easy to do.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="self-control-checks" level="4">Self Control Checks</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Some complications call for a self-control check. This is a flat DC check. The cost for your complication may vary depending on how easy it is:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>You resist quite rarely (DC 17): 2 x listed cost.</li>  <li>You resist fairly often (DC 13): 1.5 x listed cost.</li>  <li>You resist quite often (DC 9): listed cost.</li>  <li>You resist almost all the time (DC 6): 0.5 x listed cost.</li></ul></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="reaction-rolls" level="4">Reaction Rolls</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Some complications say that you take a penalty to reaction rolls. By default, this game assumes that people begin with a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/disposition-and-attitude" target="_blank">set disposition</a> toward you based on the story. For most NPCs, this means they are "Indifferent" to you until you do something in the story (or use a skill or ability) to change that. However, if you have a flaw that indicates you have a penalty to reaction rolls, this means two things:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Immediately upon the NPC being triggered by your complication (very often when they first meet you), you MUST make a flat DC 10 check. If you fail, the NPC's disposition begins one level worse than normal. If you critically fail, it begins at two worse. You may attempt to raise this disposition using all the normal tools available to a character to do so.</br></li>  <li>You take this penalty on any social skill that seems applicable, typically deception and diplomacy, when interacting with someone who would take that penalty.</br></li></ul></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="complications-and-alignment" level="4">Complications and Alignment</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Some complications list an alignment next to the category, specifically either &quot;Chaotic&quot; or &quot;Lawful.&quot; By default (though work with your DM if you are unhappy with how this turns out,) these complications actually indicate what alignment type you must choose at character creation:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>If you have more complications with either, your alignment prefix must be that type (so if you have 3 chaotic complications and 1 lawful complication, but you are good, you must be chaotic good.) </br></li>  <li>If you have no complications with either, your alignment can be whatever you pick.</br></li>  <li>If you have both chaotic and lawful complications, but the same number of each, your alignment prefix must be &quot;neutral.&quot; (So if you have 2 chaotic and 2 lawful complications, but you are good, you must be neutral good.)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div></div>
