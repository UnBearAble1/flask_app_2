</br><h1>Anklyosaurus</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Squat, heavily armored quadrupeds, ankylosauruses are stubborn and irascible. Although they're herbivores, they have been known to attack other creatures that trespass within territory simply out of ill temper.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ankylosauruses have few natural predators, as their bony hides are covered in spiked nubs that jut in many different directions to discourage larger creatures from biting them. They have mighty tails ending in an immense knot of bone, which they use to whip at threats with incredible speed and power. While these low-to-the-ground dinosaurs can trample human-sized or smaller foes, their relatively squat stance prevents them from doing so against larger targets. An ankylosaurus is about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs over 3 tons.</div><div><br /></div><div>The ankylosaurus is the largest of the heavily armored dinosaurs called ankylosaurids, but smaller versions exist as well. Still Large in size, these smaller dinosaurs, such as the 16-foot long pinacosaurus, lack the trample ability and are rarely above 4th level. Regardless of size, ankylosaurids tend to be relatively muted in coloration, with mixes of black, brown, and gray. When captive, an ankylosaurus's keeper might paint its scales bright colors to signify to others that is not a wild creature.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Animal (Nature</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Huge, Animal, Dinosaur, Soldier</br></strong></div><div>Perception +9; low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet</div><div>Skills Athletics +13</div><div>Str +7, Dex +0, Con +4, Int -4, Wis +2, Cha -1</div><div><strong>AC 21 ; Fort +11 , Ref +7 , Will +9</strong></div><div><strong>HP 102</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Tail: Melee Single Action +10 (+5 / +0) (backswing, reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8+6 bludgeoning plus punishing tail</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Punishing Tail: A creature struck by the anklyosaurus's tail must attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save.
