While generally not used for combat outside of Song'o culture, some halflings have become so proficient as to make it just as effective as a blade in a fight. Many halflings will even sing to maintain a certain tempo and rhythm during combat.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Backswing:</strong></div><div>You can use the momentum from a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Nonlethal:</strong></div><div>An effect with this trait is not inherently deadly. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a -2 circumstance penalty.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Shove:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone.</br></div></div>
