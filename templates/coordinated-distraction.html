</br><h1>Coordinated Distraction</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>3 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Warrior; Teamwork<br /></br>1 Action; Concentration; Prerequisite: Expert in Warrior</strong><br /></br>With a sharp whistle or wave of your hands, you distract an opponent from the fact that one of your allies is about to attack them. Choose a target and an ally, both of whom must be within 30 feet. The target is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> against the first <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> the ally makes on their next turn; if your ally doesn't Strike that target, the effect is lost. Depending on how you describe your distraction, this action gains either the auditory or visual trait.</div></div>
