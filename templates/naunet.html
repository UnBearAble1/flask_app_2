</br><h1>Naunet</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Pugnacious and powerfully muscled, naunets serve as scouts and rank-and-file troops of protean armies. Resembling a thick salamander with a wide head, a powerful tail, and tentacles tipped with snapping jaws in place of rear legs, naunets are the most bestial of the proteans and occupy one of their lowest castes. Naunets are 12 feet long and weigh 900 pounds.</div><div><br /></div><div>All proteans are prone to unpredictable fits and unexpected action, but compared to most others, naunets are much more bestial. Always ready for a fight, naunets pride themselves in acting swiftly and striking before unpleasant distractions like diplomacy can blunt a combat's beginning.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Monitor (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CN, Large, Monitor, Protean, Brute</strong></div><div>Perception +8; entropy sense (imprecise) 30 feet, darkvision</div><ul></br>  <li>Entropy Sense (divination, divine, prediction) A naunet can anticipate the most likely presence of a creature through a supernatural insight into chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants it the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of nondetection or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense.</li></ul><div>Languages Abyssal, Celestial, Protean</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +7, Athletics +11, Intimidation +9, Stealth +7, Survival +5</div><div>Str +5, Dex +3, Con +5, Int +0, Wis +3, Cha +3</div><div><strong>AC 19; Fort +11 , Ref +7 , Will +9; +1 status to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 100 (fast healing 2); Resistances precision 5, protean anatomy 10; Weaknesses lawful 5</strong></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Protean Anatomy </strong>(divine, transmutation) A naunet's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the naunet takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.</li>  <li><strong>Other Naunet Resistances:</strong> The naunet is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If blinded or deafened, the naunet automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.</li></ul><div><strong>Speed 25 feet, fly 30 feet, swim 25 feet; (Freedom of Movement, see spells)</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Jaws; Melee Single Action: +9 (+4 / -1) (chaotic, magical, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d12+6 piercing plus 1d6 chaotic</li>  <li>Tail; Melee Single Action: +9 (+4 / -1) (chaotic, magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 2d10+6 bludgeoning plus 1d6 chaotic and <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/grab-monster-ability" target="_blank">Grab</a></li>  <li>Tentacle; Melee Single Action: +9 (+5 / +1) (agile, chaotic, magical, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d10+6 piercing plus 1d6 chaotic and <em>confounding slam</em></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Confounding Slam (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) A creature hit by the naunet's tentacle Strike is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/stupefied" target="_blank">stupefied</a> 2 for 1d4 rounds (DC 19 Will negates).
