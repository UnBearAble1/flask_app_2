Your character must be wielding a shield in one hand to make use of it, and it grants its bonus to AC only if they use an action to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/raise-a-shield" target="_blank">Raise a Shield</a>. This action grants the shield's bonus to AC as a circumstance bonus until their next turn starts. A shield's Speed penalty applies whenever your character is holding the shield, whether they have raised it or not.</div></div>
