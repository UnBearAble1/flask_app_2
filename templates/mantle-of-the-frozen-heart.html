Freezing air emanates from your body, sending a chill down anyone's spine who draws too close and leaving a fine dusting of frost in your wake. Upon Casting this Spell, pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Chilling Ice</strong> The ice around your body thickens, melting off to protect you from heat while inuring you from the cold. You gain resistance 10 to fire and cold.</li>  <li><strong>Heart of Ice</strong> Your body temperature plummets to blistering cold. Any creature that touches you, or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon attack, takes 3d6 cold damage.</li>  <li><strong>Ice Glide</strong> Ice trails from your feet for an instant as you move, allowing you to skate rapidly along the ice. You don't need to Balance on ice, and you ignore <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/difficult-terrain" target="_blank">difficult terrain</a> caused by ice or snow. You gain a +20-foot status bonus to your land Speed. Each five foot square you move through becomes difficult terrain for the duration of the spell. IF it was already difficult terrain, it becomes greater difficult terrain.</br></li>  <li><strong>Icy Claws</strong> Your hands morph into vicious, piercing claws of ice useful for attacking or climbing. As long as you have both hands free, you gain a climb Speed equal to your land Speed. You gain a claw unarmed attack with the agile and finesse traits, in the brawling weapon group. You can use your spellcasting skill to attack with these claws. Your claw attack deals 2d6 piercing damage as its base damage, plus an additional 2d6 cold damage.</li></ul></div>
