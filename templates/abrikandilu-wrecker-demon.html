</br><h1>Abrikandilu (Wrecker Demon)</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 4</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Wrecker demons, also known as abrikandilus, despise beautiful things and do everything in their power to destroy both people and objects regarded as such. An abrikandilu forms from the souls mortals who were vandals, misanthropes, or defacers of artwork, particularly if their destructive actions stemmed from feelings of powerful envy.</div><div><br /></div><div>An abrikandilu loathes only one thing more than beauty: their own visage. The mere sight of their face--reflected in a mirror, a shield, or even a pool of water-- can send a wrecker demon into a rage. Many demon slayers leverage tactic to their advantage, venturing into battle with polished steel shields and cold iron blades at the ready.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fiend (Religion)<br /></br><br /></br><strong>CE, Medium, Demon, Fiend, Soldier</br></strong></div><div>Perception +7; darkvision</div><div>Languages Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic; telepathy 100 feet</div><div>Skills Athletics +8, Intimidation +4</div><div>Str +4, Dex +1, Con +3, Int -2, Wis +2, Cha +0</div><div><strong>AC 19; Fort +9, Ref +7, Will +5</strong></div><div><strong>HP 48; Weaknesses cold iron 5, good 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Hatred of Mirrors: </br>An abrikandilu loathes the sight of their reflection. When a creature Interacts with a mirror within sight of the wrecker demon, the demon takes a -2 penalty to Will saves against Intimidation checks. An abrikandilu that ends their turn adjacent to a mirror or that's attacked by a creature holding a mirror takes 1d6 mental damage (this usually leads abrikandilus to focus their efforts on destroying nearby mirrors using Wreck).</div><div><br /></div><div>Actions;</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Claws; Melee Single Action; +8 [+4/+0] (agile), Damage 2d6+4 slashing</li>  <li>Bite; Melee Single Action; +8 [+3/-1], Damage 2d8+4 piercing plus mutilating bite</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Mutilating Bite (curse, divine, necromancy) When the abrikandilu hits a creature with a jaws Strike, the creature must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or become physically mutilated.
