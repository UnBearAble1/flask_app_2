</br><h1>Brewer's Regret</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>MASTER</strong></div><div><strong>Alchemical, Consumable</strong></div><div><strong>Cost: </strong>35 gp</div><div><strong>Usage</strong> held in 1 hand; Bulk L</div><div><strong>Activate</strong> Single Action Interact</div><div><br /></div><div>When a brewer makes a batch of something they'd rather not drink, they often boil it down; add myrrh, mugwort extract, and violet salt; and sell it to chefs looking for cheap sandwich fillings. The thick, salty sourness ruins the taste of most other food, but it also creates a strong desire to live to taste anything else. For 1 hour after consumption, you gain a +2 item bonus to saves against death and negative effects. In addition, your <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//doomed" target="_blank">doomed</a> value decreases by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the doomed condition with brewer's regret only once per day, and after you do, you can't reduce the doomed condition from the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//restoration" target="_blank">restoration</a> spell that same day (or vice versa).</div><div><br /></div></div>
