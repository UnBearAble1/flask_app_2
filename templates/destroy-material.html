</br><h1>Destroy Material</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></div><div><strong>[Base: 12, Mod +8]</br></strong></div><div><strong>Activation: Instantaneous</strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You outright destroy non living, non magical matter. Instead of dealing damage with a special move, you simply disintegrate matter entirely, reducing it to dust.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>To destroy an object being actively held by another unwilling person, you need to succeed on a Reflex attack</li>  <li>Typically, you cannot target individual components or sections of a combined or connected object (such as destroying an individual screw in a door, or a 20 cubic foot section of a mountain). You must target single, standalone objects.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Maximum Dimensions</strong></br>start at 1x1x1 foot. You can increase this per each of the three dimensions by increasing the cost. For each +1 to the three sides, increase the Mod by +2. So if you could destroy a 10x10x10 foot cube, that would be 9 increases, so an additional Mod +18.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Additionally, if your maximum size is 10x10x10 or larger, increase the Base by +4.</br></li>  <li>If your maximum size is 20x20x20 or larger, increase the Base by +8.</br>(the maximum size is a 30x30x30 foot cube)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Other Modifications:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Nuanced: You can target specific parts of a combined item (such as just the hilt of a sword) or area sections of an object (such as a section of the ground). To destroy internal components of something you otherwise wouldn't be able to see (such as destroying all the ink in a book), make sure to pick up the "includes unknown information" boost. (Linked skill: Thievery)</br>(Base +4)</li>  <li>Can destroy magical matter, but this typically requires a counteract check, which can only be attempted each 24 hours (Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>The destruction doesn't leave dust. The matter simply ceases to exist altogether (Mod +4).</br></li>  <li>Temporary: Instead of destroying the matter, you cause it to temporarily cease to exist. This ability now has the Activated: Duration tag, which dictates its durations (and can be modified by limits and boosts.) You can end this effect if it also has the sustained or concentration limit. Any creature caught within matter when it reappears is shunted to an area adjacent to the matter of their choice (Mod +10)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>This is the only way you can use Destroy matter: (Mod +2 </br>instead of +10).</li>    </ul>  </li></ul></div>
