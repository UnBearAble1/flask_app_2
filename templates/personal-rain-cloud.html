It stays roughly an arm's length overhead, unless it must drift lower to fit under a ceiling. The cloud rains constantly on the target, keeping it wet and dampening the ground in the wake of any movement. The rain extinguishes non-magical flames. The target gains fire resistance 4. Creatures with weakness to water take damage equal to their weakness at the end of each of their turns. Creatures can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the cloud.</div><div><br /></div><div>Heightened: </br>The amount of fire resistance increases by 4.</div></div>
