Retrocognition reveals psychic impressions from events that occurred over the course of the last year throughout the first minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next year back the next minute, and so on. These echoes don't play out like a vision but instead reveal impressions of emotions and metaphors that provide cryptic clues and details of the past. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent event through an impression, the spell ends unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC of at least 20 and possibly as much as 25, depending on the severity of the event. The GM determines whether an event is traumatic and chooses the DC.</div></div>
