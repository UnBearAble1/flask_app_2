data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">STEP THREE: Adept Statistics and Choices (If any) </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>There is currently one type of Adept: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/magic-and-spellcasting" target="_blank">Spellcasting</a>. If you picked either the Hybrid or Adept bases, you gain access to it.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Ultimately Adept Abilities (Spells) are created exactly like normal Abilities (See Step Four) except are far, far cheaper, and use their own subsystems with very specific rules. Playing a character with access to Adept abilities means having a far more robust list of things you can do at the expense of being limited to a specific ruleset and having reduced hit points and weapon and armor traits.</br><br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">STEP FOUR: Purchase your Abilities </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>You get 70 creation points to purchase your abilities.</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/creating-abilities" target="_blank">Click here for the full rules</a>.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Abilities represent everything that makes your character special. They help further specialize you into skills, give you unique combat advantages, or even give a wide variety of uncanny powers. Think of Abilities like feats, class abilities, and super powers all rolled into one.</br><br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">STEP FIVE: Select your Complications (Optional) </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Complications are similar to abilities, except they complicate your character's life and generate hero points that you can spend later. (Note that, typically, you also get a hero point each time you roll a critical failure and suffer a consequence.)</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Hero Points: </strong>At any point, you can spend any number of hero points to do one of the following:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Change a natural 1 to a 2: This costs 3 hero points.</br></li>  <li>Improve a roll of 2 or higher: add a +1 for each hero point spent, even after you know the result of the roll (unless the roll is secret, in which you must decide to spend them prior to rolling.) </br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>No character may ever have more than 10 hero points at any time.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Most complications actually run the risk of giving you a story setback of some kind. You get hero points when the complication actually limits or derails your (the player, not the character) plans or intentions. Typically, you do not get hero point rewards for a complication causing you trouble that was already within the scope and intention of your character due to the theme of the game or the purview of the story. Specifically, if the entire party was already going to do a thing, you won't get hero points for your complication triggering your character to actually do that thing you were already going to do anyway. The complication has to actually be a complication to not just your character, but your player intentions and best interests. Further, you must have no control over when the complication becomes an issue. It's not something you can turn on and off.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>When a setback happens, consult the following to determine how many hero points you are awarded.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Story Setback Categories:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Inconsequential: </strong>This is mostly flavor. (0 Hero Points)</br></li>  <li><strong>Minor</strong>: The setback is mostly an inconvenience or insult (1 hero point)</br></li>  <li><strong>Moderate</strong>: The setback costs you time, mild reputation concerns, or adds the remote possibility of consequences further down the road (2 hero points)</br></li>  <li><strong>Major</strong>: The setback costs you serious time, some resources or reputation. This includes dangerous outcomes, like battle with a non-inconsequential foe (again, that you weren't going to fight anyway.) (3 hero points)</br></li>  <li><strong>Catastrophic</strong>: The setback completely derails your intentions, puts you in serious danger, or greatly damages your reputation or resources (5 hero points)</br><br /></br></li></ul><div><strong>Story Driven Complications and Suggested Mechanics </strong>(feel free to work with your GM for different mechanics, but remember that your character should not be able to turn the complication on and off):</br></div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Offensive to NPCs</strong>: For some reason, your character really offends some NPCs they meet. Determine what kind of NPCs are offended, and why, and then work with your GM to see if that fits within the game structure. Examples could be: Your character is a member of a second class of citizen, and those bigoted against them would be offended, they could have odious personal habits that offend the haughty, or perhaps are simply cursed to offend everyone they meet. Each and every time your complication is triggered, make a flat check. If the flat check fails, the NPCs disposition starts as one lower than normal. If it fails by 5 or more, it starts as 2 lower. The default DC is 5, but you can raise that as high as 15 if you wish.</br></li>  <li><strong>Required Behavior:</strong> Your character must behave in a certain way in certain situations. When you encounter a situation in which you, the player, would prefer your character to act in a way counter to the required behavior - you get a flat check. If the flat check fails, your character must follow their required behavior. The default DC is 5, but you can raise that as high as 15 if you wish.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Mechanical</br> Setbacks:</br> </strong>Mechanical setbacks tend to have pre-written distribution of hero points, based on how they work. Below are suggested complications, though feel free to </br>work with your GM for different mechanics, but remember that your character should not be able to turn the complication on and off. Further, hero point rewards should correspond to the severity of the setback.</br></div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Defense Limitations</strong>:</br> You have a penalized defense, or take disadvantage on a type of defense rolls.</br>These penalties could be limited to specific situations.</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>If you fail a saving throw because of this penalty, gain 3 hero points.</br></li>      <li>If you critically fail a saving throw because of this penalty, gain 6 hero points.</br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Weakness to Damage:</strong></br> You take an extra 5 or extra 10 points of damage from a damage type.</br>You only gain hero points from this if the damage you take was unintentional, from an enemy or from a hazard.</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>You gain 1 hero points for taking 5 extra damage</br></li>      <li>You gain 3 hero points for taking 10 extra damage</br></li>      <li>If you gain a Serious Wound <em>because</em> of this damage, gain +2 hero points</br></li>      <li>If you gain a Grievous Wound <em>because</em> of this damage, gain +4 hero points</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Perception Limitations:</strong></br> You have a penalty or disadvantage on perception checks, gained in certain situations or all the time. Gain points based on the story chart, or 2 points if you would have gone before a creature in initiative if it weren't for the penalty.</br></li>  <li><strong>Movement Limitations:</strong> You have a penalty to movement speed. Gain points based on the story chart, or 3 points for each action you have to use in combat that you otherwise would not have had to use to achieve a specific tactical goal.</br></li>  <li><strong>Skill Limitations</strong>: You have disadvantage on a skill, possibly in specific situations. Use the story chart depending on the consequences, but only if you would have otherwise made the skill challenge.</br></br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Alignment (Story AND Mechanical)</strong>: By default your character has an unclear alignment, representing a more mercurial nature. This means your character isn't particularly limited to any type of behavior, and never takes alignment damage. If a divination ability attempts to detect their alignment, it detects this amorphous, mercurial nature unbound by destiny instead of good, evil, law or chaos.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>However, you can select an alignment as a complication. Alignment limits you in two ways:</br></div><div><br /></div><ol></br>  <li>Required Behavior. As described above, your character must behave in a certain way in certain situations. When you encounter a situation in which you, the player, would prefer your character to act in a way counter to the required behavior - you get a flat check. If the flat check fails, your character must follow their required behavior. The default DC is 5, but you can raise that as high as 15 if you wish.</br></li>  <li>Alignment Damage: If you have a non-neutral alignment type, you can take damage from the opposing alignment damage type. If you do, you gain hero points. You only gain hero points from this if the damage you take was unintentional, from an enemy or from a hazard.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>You gain 1 hero point for every 10 points of alignment damage you take (if you don't take at least 5, you gain no hero points).</br></li>      <li>If you gain a Serious Wound because of this damage, gain +2 hero points</br></li>      <li>If you gain a Grievous Wound because of this damage, gain +4 hero points</li>    </ul>  </li></ol><div><br /></div><div>&quot;Good&quot; implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings Why is this a complication? Because good characters make personal sacrifices to help others.</div><div><br /></div><div>&quot;Evil&quot; implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient. Why is this a complication? Because your desire for cruelty may land you in trouble. <br /></br><br /></br>&quot;Law&quot; implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability. Why is this a complication? lawfulness can include close-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, and a lack of adaptability.</div><div><br /></div><div>&quot;Chaos&quot; implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. Why is this a complication? Chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility.</div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">STEP SIX: Design Your Gear </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>You can customize your weapons and armor at character creation.
