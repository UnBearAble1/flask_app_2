When using Prescient Planner, you can procure a consumable item from your backpack, instead of a piece of adventuring gear. The consumable item must still be common with a level no higher than half (round down) of your proficiency tier in in Society, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn't have made you encumbered.</div></div>
