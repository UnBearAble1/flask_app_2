</br><h1>Advanced Alchemy</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Exploration</strong></div><div>During your daily preparations, you gain a number of Advanced Alchemy Points equal to your total skill (including INT mod) with Alchemist (so if you were an expert Alchemist [+4] with an Int of +2, you'd have 6 Advanced Alchemy Points per day). You regain these points each Daily Preparations. </br>During your Daily Preparations, you can spend these points to craft Alchemical Items you have the formulas for. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again. The point cost for items is based on their tier:</br></div><div><br /></br>Trained: </br>1</br></div><div>Expert: 2</div><div>Master: 6</div><div>Legendary: (impossible to craft with Advanced Alchemy)</div><div><br /></div><div>Note, you may want to save some of your Advanced Alchemy points as a safety net for Quick Alchemy.</div></div>
