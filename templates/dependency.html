This could be ingesting a drug or magic potion, carrying a magical object, or spending time in the soil of your native land or at a shrine to your God, or any other similar such dependency. There are a few vectors for the point value of Dependency:</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Frequency of your use:</strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Daily: Lose 5 HP per hour after missing a daily dose. (5 pts)</li>  <li>Weekly: Lose 5 HP per six hours after missing a weekly dose. (3 pts)</li>  <li>Bi-Weekly: Lose 5 HP per day after missing a monthly dose. (1 pts)</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Rarity</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Rare (cannot be bought; must be found or made): x3 points.</li>  <li>Occasional (very expensive or hard to find): x2 points.</li>  <li>Common (expensive or somewhat hard to find): x1 points.<br /></br></li></ul><div><strong>Legality</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Illegal: (-1 total points)</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>If you don't need to consume something, and instead need to touch or spend time with something, then you have to do so for time equal to your damage interval. For example, if you need to spend time in prayer at places of magical power, and you picked "Weekly: Lose 5 HP per six hours" then you need to spend six hours a week in prayer at a place of magical power.</div><div><br /></div></div>
