Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/deception-chr" target="_blank">Deception</a> check and compare it against the Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it's impossible to get anyone to believe them.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the GM's discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might attempt a Perception check later to Sense Motive against your Deception DC to realize it's a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.</div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Success</strong> The target believes your lie.</li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> The target doesn't believe your lie and gains a +4 circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.</li></ul></div>
