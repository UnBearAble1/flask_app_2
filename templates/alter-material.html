</br><h1>Alter Material</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Activation: Duration</br></strong></div><div><strong>Linked Skill: Crafting</strong></br></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You can transform nonliving, non magical matter into a different arrangement.</br>This ability has quite a few restrictions, so read them thoroughly:<br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>To alter a manufactured object that has not been in your possession for at least 24 hours, you must succeed at a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//counteracting" target="_blank">counteract</a> check versus the Crafting Skill of the person who created it.</br></li>  <li>To alter an object being actively held by another unwilling person, you need to succeed on both a Reflex attack and a counteract check above (two separate rolls.)</br></li>  <li>Typically, you cannot target individual components or sections of a combined or connected object (such as shrinking an individual screw in a door, or a 20 cubic foot section of a mountain). You must target single, standalone objects.</br></li>  <li>Altered objects have tell-tale signs of manipulation, and thus have no intrinsic sale value for the nature of their material.</br></li>  <li>You cannot alter an object in such a way that it envelopes a creature fully, without leaving it at least 5 feet of space on all sides. If you are still able to fully envelope a creature (with 5 feet of space on all sides), it still gets a Reflex defense. On a success, it moves to the nearest square to it that is adjacent to your creation. If your alteration is so large that it is bigger than their speed, they are unable to get this defense.</br></li>  <li>If multiple selections made below provide different default durations, pick the shortest one. You cannot end this effect prematurely unless you have the sustained or concentration limits.</li>  <li>If an item is broken or destroyed in its new form, it may not be when the duration ends. Track the individual attacks and damage done to an item, and apply those again when it returns, but with the item's original hardness and hit points. Typically this means that while you can turn a stone wall into paper, then easily slice through it with a sword, when the duration ends the stone wall will fully reappear with a few scratches on it.</li>  <li>If an item is separated out (usually because you change a solid object into a liquid one, or something similar), all of its various components will disappear when the duration expires and only the largest component will remain, which will reform into the original item at full volume.</br></li>  <li>You may want an ability that can alter things you cannot see, because they are part of a bigger whole (being able to alter all instances of a particular name in a book, without you having to personally go and find them all). In those cases, make sure to pick up the "Includes Unknown Information" boost.</br></li>  <li>By default any changes you make that would have artistic or crafting quality is either automatically detected as a magical fabrication (which intrinsically is off-putting enough to sapient creatures to disqualify it as 'art' or give it value.) If you instead make an appropriate check using a relevant skill you have, that represents the artistic quality of your alteration.</br><br /></br></li></ul><div><strong>Designing your Alter Matter Ability:</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>When picking this effect, you must make a number of selections which will modify its total cost.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Degree of alteration:</strong> You can select one or more of the following types of alteration to be part of this effect, each increasing its cost and Tier requirements, but are combined for purposes of actions required to activate.</br><br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Cosmetic: You can change the design style or coloring, but this alone cannot have a functional effect, including altering its dimensions in any meaningful way.</br> This also includes the ability to alter the flavor of food or drink. The cost is based on the degree of cosmetic shift <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//the-quality-spectrum" target="_blank">along this spectrum</a>. </br>Remember that most creatures automatically know the work is a result of magic, but if you pass a relevant skill check to the alteration, they associate it with that skill instead.</br>Default Duration: 24 hours. (Base: 2)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Boost: Creatures don't automatically know the cosmetic quality has been altered, but can attempt to detect it with a perception or lore check (Mod: +5)</br><br /></br><br /></br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Surface: You can change surface effects, such as images, glyphs, symbols and text. This can let you change the text of a book, alter a painting, or the like. This doesn't intrinsically change magic associated with the surface symbols (you couldn't use this ability to overcome a glyph trap, for example). Default Duration: 24 hours. (Base: 3, Mod +1)</br><br /></br><br /></br></li>  <li>Change Shape: You can change the overall shape of the object into an entirely new shape, matching the same total volume from before. Default Duration is 10 minutes. Specify how complex an item your end result can be:</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Very simple, like a wall, a sphere, a block or other simple shapes (Base: 8, Mod +16)</br></li>      <li>Simple, like a common tool or piece of furniture with no moving parts (Base: 8, Mod +18)</br></li>      <li>Moderate, like a common tool with 2-3 moving parts, or an object with designs, writing or art on it (Base: 12, Mod +18)</br></li>      <li>Complex, like a kit or complex object or tool, or very intricate or exact design of something (Base: 12, Mod +22) <br /></br><br /></br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Change Size: You can change the volume of the object, per +/- 10%. Note, no object can be shrunk beyond 1% of its original size, or increased beyond 300% of its original size. This size alteration also decreases or increases the mass of the object to be appropriate to its new size. The default duration is 10 minutes.</br>(Mod +1 per +/- 10% change, base cost depends on threshold: </br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>-10% through -40%: (Base: 4)</br></li>      <li>-50% or more (Base: 8)</br></li>      <li>+10% through +100% (Base: 4)</br></li>      <li>+110% through +200% (Base: 8)</br></li>      <li>+210% through +300% (Base: 12)</br><br /></br><br /></br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Change Material: You can change the material of the object to an alternate material. The change in material will inevitably change the mass, but not the size. The default duration is 10 minutes. There are three flavors:</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Similar Classification: From one type of wood to another, one type of metal to another, one type of stone to another, or the like. (Base: 3)</li>      <li>Similar Integrity: From one 'hard' material to another, such as wood to stone or metal, or one soft material to another, such leather to cloth. (Base: 8, Mod +4)</br></li>      <li>State Change: You can change the state of the material, including granulating the material. For example, you could turn a block of stone into fine gravel, or into mud, or turn water into ice. The state change must be supported by the material, meaning you couldn't turn wood into a liquid, but you could turn it into fine sawdust. (Base: 12, Mod +8)</br></li>      <li>Any to Any: You can turn any material into any other material. Your only limit is that you can't shift state changes more than one degree from solid &gt; liquid &gt; gas. You could turn a gas to a liquid, or a solid to a liquid, but not a solid to a gas. (Base: 16, Mod +24).</br><br /></br></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></br><br /></br><strong>Maximum Size:</strong> Default maximum size of a target object for Alter Matter is one that could fit in a 1x1x1 foot cube.</br>You can increase this per each of the three dimensions by increasing the cost. For each +1 to the three sides, increase the Mod by +2. So if you could alter a 10x10x10 foot cube, that would be 9 increases, so an additional Mod +18. <br /></br></div><div><strong><br /></br>Modifications:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Sustenance: Items you morph into Food or water (that weren't already food or water) with this power can be consumed for nutrition. The duration of this effect must be 24 hours or greater, and it cannot have a limit allowing you to end it early. Without this feature, even if you created food it wouldn't provide any sustenance to the consumer. (Mod +5).</br></li>  <li>Nuanced: You can target specific parts of a combined item (such as just the hilt of a sword) or area sections of an object (such as a section of the ground). This gains the Linked Skill: Thievery (Base +4</li>  <li>You can alter magical matter, but this requires a counteract check against the effect, which can only be attempted once per 24 hours (Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>You can only have one altered item in existence at one time. (Mod -4)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
