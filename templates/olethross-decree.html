The first time this turn that you hit a creature with a Strike using a weapon in the bow group you've modified in this way, that creature takes an additional 6d6 damage (basic Fortitude save) as the arrow works to cut short their very destiny. This additional damage is of the same type as the initial attack dealt, and is combined with the damage of the arrow. If you hit more than one creature at the same time, choose one to suffer the effect of your decree.</div></div>
