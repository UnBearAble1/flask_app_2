</br><h1>Exploration</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>These abilities help you explore the world around you, but aren't specifically survival or movement abilities.</div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Appendage Effects</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Extra Appendage</strong></div><div><strong>(Mod: 2)</br></strong></div><div>You have an extra body part (tongue, living hair, living shadow, snake arms, etc) that can retrieve loose objects. You can Interact to pick up a single unattended object of light Bulk or less within 15 feet. If you don't have enough hands free to hold the object, it falls to the ground in your space.</br><br /></br><br /></br>Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Boost: You can perform simple Interact actions with it, such as opening an unlocked door. It can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items. You get +2 to deception checks to prevent people from noticing that you have the appendage to use in this fashion (for example, if you were being bound to a chair, your kidnapper may realize they should bind your hair as well.) (Mod +3)</br></li>  <li>Boost: You can use it to Steal an object, though it still can't hold onto it at the end of your action. If you have a hand free, you can transfer the stolen object to your hand. Otherwise, your appendage surreptitiously drops it on the ground in your space, where you can grab it later. Observers other than your target who haven't witnessed you stealing something with it are usually <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//create-a-diversion" target="_blank">distracted</a>, meaning the GM will usually decrease their Perception DCs, as normal for <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//steal" target="_blank">Stealing</a> something. (Mod +3)</li>  <li>Boost: You can hold an item with it, or use it for the same actions you could your hand. (Base: 12, Mod +18).</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></br><strong>Stretching Limbs</br></strong></div><div><strong>(Mod: 6)</br></strong></div><div>You can stretch your body, increasing the range in which you interact with objects with one of your hands by 5 feet. You can also use it to step over obstacles if it makes sense, such as stepping over a 7 foot gap (as a medium creature). If you want to be able to use this reach in combat somehow (beyond interacting with objects), then look through the options in Special Attack.</br>If you want improvements to climbing, consider adding in Climbing effects or Enhanced Activity Use.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Boost: The range increases to 10 extra feet. (Mod +5)</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Prehensile Feet</br></strong></div><div><strong>(Mod: 5)</br></strong></div><div>You can use your toes and feet to interact with objects (and hold and use them) just as you could with your hands. Standing on one leg will often require you make balance checks if you are attacked or moved in any way, or risk falling prone. In many cases, this may allow you to climb without hands or hang from your feet as well.</br></div><div></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Bond Objects</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Base: 8, Mod +6<br /></br>Activation: Duration</br></strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch, Default Duration: 1 year</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You can bind two objects or willing creatures together, creating a nearly unbreakable adhesive bond. The bond can never accidentally or consequently break, but a creature can attempt to break with a Force Open check (the DC for you to oppose this is typically 2, unless the creature is incredibly powerful, then it can get as high as 5.) The adhered objects tend to break before the bond does unless they are particularly durable, though a creature determined to separate the objects can break off the parts connected by the bond and later Repair the objects.</br></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Breadcrumb Trail </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>[Base: 2]</br></strong></div><div><strong>Activation: Duration</br></strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: 30 feet<br /></br>Default Duration: 8 hours</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You cause a willing creature to leave a glittering trail behind it that lasts for the duration. This trail doesn't denote the direction or the order of its path--it merely indicates where the target has moved during the effect's duration.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The creature can be unwilling, but it gets a will defense (Mod +2) </br></li>  <li>The trail can only be seen by you, or other creatures you designate at the time of activation (Base +2)</li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Excavate </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br><strong>[Base: 4]</br></strong></div><div><strong>Activate: Instantaneous, Linked Skill: Athletics</strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch. </br><br /></br>Default Area: 2.5 foot burst (1 5x5 foot cube)<br /></br></strong></div><div>You can magically excavate loose dirt, dust, gravel, sand, and the like (though not solid stone). The material scatters evenly on the ground over a burst twice the size of the area. If you dig further into a hole, this scatter continues at the beginning of the hole, to a maximum default range of 30 feet (this can be modified with limits and boosts)</br></div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Remote Interaction (Telekinesis) </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><strong><br /></br>Activation: Duration</br></strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: 30 feet (maximum range: 500 feet)</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You can interact with objects at a distance without touching them. These objects must be unattended. If you wish to use the ability to disarm, grapple, fly, or other function - take each of those effects separately or as a combined ability with this one. Because the object must be unattended, you couldn't sit in a chair and use it to fly you around or similar feats.</br><br /></br></div><div>Lifting Capacity:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>1 Bulk or Less (15kg or 33lbs) (Base: 4)</br></li>  <li>5 Bulk or Less (75kg or 165lbs) (Base 4, Mod +3)</br></li>  <li>10 Bulk or Less (150kg or 330lbs) (Base: 8, Mod +2)</br></li>  <li>300kg or 661lbs (Base: 12, Mod +8)</br></li>  <li>500kg or 1102lbs (Base: 16, Mod +14)</br></li>  <li>2500kg or 5510lbs (Base: 16, Mod +34)<br /></br></li></ul><div>Speed of Mobility:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>30 feet per action (default)</br></li>  <li>60 feet per action (Base +4, Mod +8)</br></li>  <li>120 feet per action (Base +8, Mod +8)</br><br /></br></li></ul><div>Manual Dexterity:</br></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Vertical Lift only (Mod -8)</br></li>  <li>Any single direction (default)</br></li>  <li>Multiple directional pushing, as if applying force with the end of a club in each hand (Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>Equivalent of using your hands and fingers (Mod +10)</br></li>  <li>Precise control as if using fine tools (Base +8, mod +16) </br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Boost: Platformer: If you have an object lifted, it can support creature weight as long as you hold it still. Typically because the object must be 'unattended' this wouldn't work. (Mod +20)</br></li>  <li>Boost: True Telekinesis: As long as objects being moved are attended by willing creatures, there is no 'must be unattended' restriction. (Base +8, Mod +30)</br></li>  <li>Limit: Animate Object. Rather than remotely interacting with objects to move them, you bestow them with animating force that allows them to move autonomously within confines. Using this modification means you use your actions initially to animate, and the object uses an action to fulfill its purpose. Thereafter, the object moves on its own, one action per round, until it fulfills its purpose. If you want truly complex, autonomous animated objects, use the 'minion' feat instead. Use the same perimeters as normal telekinesis above, but but pick one of the following additional limits: </br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Performs a single type of action, chosen when you use the ability (A rope ties itself, a door opens, a lantern flies, pants fly off) (Mod -12)</br></li>      <li>Can adapt to the situation intelligently, allowing it to perform more complex orders (A rope ties itself around the most sturdy thing it can find in an area, a lantern follows a particular creature while flying) (Mod -6)</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Lifting and Carrying Effects</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Increased Bulk Limits</strong></div><div><strong>(Linked: Athletics)</strong></div><div>Your bulk limits are increased</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Bulk Limit +5 </br>= Mod 1.</br></li>  <li>Per each additional Bulk Limit (max +20) = Mod +1.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Body Storage</br></strong></div><div><strong>(Mod: 2)</br></strong></div><div>You can store 1 Bulk of objects within your body (cheek pouches, your shadow, hollow in your torso, or the like). Stowing and retrieving objects from your body work like any other container, though this can be modified with boosts and limits. By default there are no bonuses to conceal or palm objects, so you may want to also purchase <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//enhanced-activity-use" target="_blank">Enhanced Activity Use</a> and mix it with this using the Combined Ability rules.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Increased Packing Skill</br></strong></div><div><strong>(Mod: 1)</br></strong></div><div>You can fit an additional twice the listed Bulk capacity into mundane storage containers or vehicles. For example, you can fit 8 Bulk in a backpack, or 16 Bulk in a chest. This doesn't alter the items' Bulk, nor does it change how much you can store in a magical or extra-dimensional storage space<br /></br><br /></br></div><div><strong>Extra-dimensional Storage Space</strong></div><div><strong>Activation: Instantaneous</strong></div><div><strong>Duration: 1 hour</br></strong></div><div>You can store an object in an extra dimensional space and retrieve it.</br> Retrieving it takes one action (can be modified with limits/boosts). When you retrieve the item it either appears directly in your hand, or adjacent to you. </br>You can stow (same action requirement as retrieve) or retrieve the object as many times as possible during the duration. You can have one object stored this way for each instance you take this ability, and the object cannot be a container nor a living thing. You can modify both the duration the item can be stored and the action it takes to retrieve using limits and boosts.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The object can be up to 1 bulk (Base: 4)</br></li>  <li>The object can be up to 5 bulk (Base: 8)</br></li>  <li>The object can be up to 10 bulk (Base: 12)</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Boost: The item returns "equipped." (Mod +6)</br></li>  <li>Boost: The item can be a container, or you can store multiple items throughout the duration of your effect, though the total combined bulk cannot be greater than your maximum for this effect (Base +4, Mod +16)<br /></br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Teleport Objects</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Activation: Instantaneous</br></strong></div><div><strong>Default Starting Range: Touch</br></strong></div><div><strong>Default Teleportation Range: 30 feet</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You can teleport an object from one location to another. The object must either be unattended or attended by a willing creature.</br>You cannot teleport creatures with this ability, even if they are stored within an object.</div><div><br /></br>Size of the Object:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>1L Bulk (Base: 4)</br></li>  <li>1 Bulk or Less (15kg or 33lbs) (Base: 4, Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>5 Bulk or Less (75kg or 165lbs) (Base: 8, Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>10 Bulk or Less (150kg or 330lbs) (Base: 8, Mod +12)</br></li>  <li>300kg or 661lbs (Base: 12, Mod +18)</br></li>  <li>500kg or 1102lbs (Base: 16, Mod +30)</br></li>  <li>2500kg or 5510lbs (Base: 20, Mod +60)<br /></br></li></ul><div>Other Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The item can be automatically "equipped." upon arrival. (Mod +6)</br></li>  <li>you don't need line of sight to the target, but you must have attuned to the target at some point (a process taking 30 minutes.) (Mod +10)</br></li>  <li>You can swap two objects. Both must be viable targets for this ability. (Mod +10)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>You can ONLY swap two objects. Both must be viable targets for this ability (Mod +0 instead of Mod +10)</br></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Object Portal: You designate two points within range when using your effect, and each creates a two-way door to the other. This ability now has the Activation: Duration tag, instead of instantaneous. The portal can be any size you select, up to 10x10 feet (chosen at character creation). The portal has a visible effect. Any appropriate object tossed through the portal is transported to the other point. (Mod +30)</li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Timekeeping Effects</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Current Time</br></strong></div><div><strong>[Mod: 1]</strong></div><div><strong>Linked Skill: Survival</strong></div><div>You always know exactly what time it is</br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Synchronize Time</br></strong></div><div><strong>Activation: Duration</strong></br></div><div><strong>Default Duration: Up to 24 hours, Default Range: Touch<br /></br></strong>You can synchronize an exact time with another creature. When that time is reached, both you and the target are notified immediately. There are two versions:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Mental Connect: You and the targets automatically know when the time occurs. (Mod: 2)</br></li>  <li>Sigil: You harmlessly place a unique magic sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, on your targets. When you use the effect, you set the duration by choosing a time at which point the sigil flashes dimly three times. After that point, the effect ends. (Mod: 1)</li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div>
