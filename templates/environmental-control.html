The portal entrance is static, and physically large enough to allow the entry of one of the largest creatures the realm is capable of holding (you can choose when you create this power to limit that size to any size smaller, down to medium.) By default, the environmental conditions inside the extra dimensional realm matches that which is outside, and is an unfurnished empty void-like space -- but you could add in other environmental control, illusion, or creation effects to this ability to further modify this ability to your preferences. </br>Specifying that those abilities ONLY work within the realm typically constitutes a "very difficult setup" Situational LImit (not all abilities are so, just ones that add to the flavor of the realm itself.) Any creature who wishes to leave the space can attempt a will save be shunted to outside the door if it is blocked or sealed.</br><br /></br><br /></br><strong>Number of medium creatures it can hold, including yourself</strong> (A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and a Gargantuan creature counts as eight.)</br></div><ul></br>  <li>1 Medium Creature</br> (Base: 8)</li>  <li>4 Medium Creatures</br> (Base: 12, Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>8 Medium Creatures (Base: 16, Mod +8)</br></li>  <li>16 Medium Creatures (Base: 16, Mod +14)</br></li>  <li>32 Medium Creatures (Base: 16, Mod +20)</br></li>  <li>64 Medium Creatures (Base: 20, Mod +24)</br></li>  <li>128 Medium Creatures (Base: 20, Mod +40)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Security</strong>: By default, the portal to the extra dimensional realm is visible and always open.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The Portal is invisible to all but you, and creatures you select. (Base +4)</br></li>  <li>The Portal can be shut to all but you, and creatures you select. Creatures would need to make a Force Open check against your ability to open it (getting two points harder each time they fail, or four if they critically fail.)</br> (Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>Creatures cannot open the door at all unless you select, though creatures can still leave with a will save if they wish.

Any structure (or natural element) with enough of its key supporting elements within the area of your effect has a chance of collapsing. By default, this has no damaging effect to creatures unless you couple it with a special attack (as creatures within the structure are able to escape in time). This effect allows you to make a check to collapse the structure. The base DC for this check is 15 for a sturdy structure, 10 for a normal structure, and 5 for a flimsy structure. [Base: 12, Mod +18]</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Per -1 to DC checks (maximum -5 to DC). (Mod +6; also Base +4 at -4 to DC)</li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Gravity Control </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Activation: Duration</br></strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: 30 feet</br></strong></div><div><strong>Default Area: column (10 foot burst, but 50 feet tall)</strong></div><div><strong>Default Duration: 2/1d4 rounds</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You can control gravity in an area. Creatures in the area automatically are impacted by the gravity effects, with no defense possible. If you reduce the Area of Effect to zero, the effect applies only to a single creature (not possible for zero gravity). If that creature is unwilling, they get a fortitude defense to avoid the effect.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>High Gravity: In high gravity, creatures become encumbered. They gain a +2 status bonus to resist forced movement and attempts to knock them prone. They reduce the distance forced movement moves them by half or 10 feet, whichever is more. They can only jump half as high and far. Rather than the normal calculation for falling damage, they take bludgeoning damage equal to the distance they fall. Abilities that adjust how much falling damage they take still apply. Creatures and items in high gravity are considered twice their weight. (Base: 4)</br></li>  <li>Low Gravity: In low gravity, a creature can jump double the normal distance when they Long Jump or Leap, though still to a maximum of their Speed. When they High Jump, you can use the calculation for a Long Jump but don't double the distance. Rather than the normal calculation for falling damage, when they fall, they take no damage for the first 10 feet and then take bludgeoning damage equal to a quarter of the remaining distance they fell. Abilities that adjust how much falling damage they take still apply. Creatures and items in low gravity are considered half their weight. (Base: 8)</br></li>  <li>Zero Gravity:</br> Creatures float in place unless they can Push Off a surface. Pushing Off is a single action which has the move trait, allowing the creature to move half its Speed in a straight line through the area. After Pushing Off a surface, the creature continues to move the same distance at the start of each of its turns until it leaves the area or Pushes Off against something else. A creature pushing against an untethered object of its size or smaller causes both the creature and the object to move at the same speed, but in opposite directions. Creatures who can levitate or fly can use those abilities to move around in the area without having to push off anything. Creatures who can't levitate or fly are usually on the ground, giving them a surface from which to push off. (Base: 12, Mod +8)</br></li>  <li>Change Gravity center: You can alter the trajectory of gravity, causing all things to fall toward the 'bottom'. Your cylinder area automatically changes to orient to whatever &quot;down&quot; is. Creatures in the area when the gravity changes can typically 'grab a ledge' to avoid falling, and creatures with flight, levitation, or similar features can attempt to 'arrest a fall' and adjust their flying.

During this time, you gain one or more actions you may take before time unfreezes. While time is frozen, you are unable to interact with anyone or anything outside of your person (though you can move, possibly climbing over or squeezing through things, as long as you don't need to move them). You also cannot be perceived or interacted with by other creatures during this time.
