</br><h1>Identifying Spells</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Sometimes you need to identify a spell, especially if its effects are not obvious right away. If you notice a spell being cast, and you have it in your repertoire, you automatically know what the spell is, including the level to which it is heightened.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you want to identify a spell but don't have it in your repertoire, you must spend an action on your turn to attempt to identify it using <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a>. You typically notice a spell being cast by seeing its visual manifestations or hearing its verbal casting components. Identifying long-lasting spells that are already in place requires using <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/identify-magic" target="_blank">Identify Magic</a> instead of Recall Knowledge because you don't have the advantage of watching the spell being cast.</div></div>
