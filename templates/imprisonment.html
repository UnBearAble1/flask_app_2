</br><h1>Imprisonment</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>LEGENDARY</strong></div><div><strong>Uncommon, Evocation</strong></div><div><strong>Cast</strong> 1 day; <strong>Cost</strong> reagents to construct the magical prison worth a total value of 200gp per threat of the target; <strong>Secondary Casters</strong> 6</div><div><strong>Primary Check</strong> Arcana (legendary) or Occultism (legendary); <strong>Secondary Checks </strong>Crafting, Society</div><div><strong>Range</strong> 10 feet; <strong>Target(s)</strong> 1 creature</br></div><div><br /></div><div>You perform a ritual to imprison a creature in one of several forms. While some versions of this ritual offer all of the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by freedom. Some forms of imprisonment can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 30 and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Slumber</strong> (sleep effect) You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target--whether romantically, filially, or otherwise--frees it from the slumber. This form of imprisonment is also enchantment magic.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of imprisonment, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/dispel-magic" target="_blank">dispel magic</a> or <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/haste" target="_blank">haste</a> spell. This form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success: You imprison the target.
