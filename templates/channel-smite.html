Make a melee <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> and add the spell's damage to the Strike's damage. You have to roll both the attack AND the spell roll. This is negative damage if you expended a harm spell or positive damage if you expended a heal spell. The spell is cast with no effect if your Strike fails or hits a creature that isn't damaged by that energy type (such as if you hit a non-undead creature with a heal spell).</div></div>
