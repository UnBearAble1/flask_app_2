The queen was fascinated with the sickle-sabers in the palace treasury, and now the unusual blades are carried by her honor guard and Irriseni diplomats alike. The sickle-saber's blade curves multiple times along its 4-foot length, and its hilt is similarly curved. A small, secondary grip on the blade lets the wielder rapidly and unpredictably twist the cutting edges.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Backswing:</strong></div><div>You can use the momentum from a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Forceful:</strong></div><div>This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a +2 circumstance bonus to damage, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance +4 bonus to damage</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.
