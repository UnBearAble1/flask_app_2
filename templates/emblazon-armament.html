You can spend 10 minutes emblazoning a symbol of your deity upon a weapon or shield. The symbol doesn't fade until 1 year has passed, but if you Emblazon an Armament, any symbol you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly disappears. The item becomes a religious symbol of your deity and can be used as a divine focus while emblazoned, and it gains another benefit determined by the type of item. This benefit applies only to followers of the deity the symbol represents.</div><ul></br>  <li>Shield The shield gains a +2 status bonus to its Hardness. (This causes it to reduce more damage with the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//shield-block" target="_blank">Shield Block</a> reaction.)</li>  <li>Weapon The wielder gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.</li></ul></div>
