You create either a 5-foot-thick wall of flame in a straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high, or a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius ring of flame with the same height. The wall stands vertically in either form; if you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or height. Everything on each side of the wall is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a> from creatures on the opposite side.
