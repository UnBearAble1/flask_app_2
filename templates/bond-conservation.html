If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell using the energy from Drain Bonded Item, you gain an extra use of Drain Bonded Item. You must use this extra use of Drain Bonded Item before the end of your next turn or you lose it, and you can use this additional use only to cast a spell of a lower tier than the first spell cast with Drain Bonded Item.</div></div>
