</br><h1>Pilgrim's Token</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>2 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Religion; Initiative</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites trained in Religion</strong><br /></br>You carry a small token of protection from a site holy to your faith, or you touched your religious symbol to a relic or altar at such a site. So long as this token is in your possession, when you tie an adversary's initiative roll, you go first.<br /></br><br /></br>If you lose your pilgrim's token, you must purchase or Craft a replacement and attune it at a holy site. Such a token usually costs at least 2 sp, and the attunement takes 10 minutes of prayer and requires a successful Expert Religion check. Your GM might adjust the price and DC depending on the token's material and quality and the religious significance of the site; the more significant the location, the easier the attunement.</div></div>
