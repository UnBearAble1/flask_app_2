When throwing an alchemical bomb with the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/splash" target="_blank">splash</a> trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the target's space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes up more than a single square, the target's square closest to you is the first affected square of the cone.</div></div>
