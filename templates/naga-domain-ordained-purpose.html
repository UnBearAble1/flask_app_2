A creature that has lost abilities as a result of performing acts anathema to its deity or beliefs (such as a champion who violated their tenets and hasn't atoned) uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. At the GM's discretion, a creature currently filling its appointed station and purpose (such as a farmer working in a field or a criminal in the act of committing a crime) uses the outcome one degree of success better than the result of its saving throw.</div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected.</li>  <li>Success The creature takes half damage.</li>  <li>Failure The creature takes full damage and must <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//drop-prone" target="_blank">Drop Prone</a> as its first action on its next turn.</li>  <li>Critical Failure The creature takes double damage, must Drop Prone as its first action on its next turn, and can't Stand during its next turn.</li></ul></div>
