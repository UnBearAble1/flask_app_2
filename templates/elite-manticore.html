</br><h1>Elite Manticore</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat 6</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>The manticore is a monstrous amalgamation of insect, dragon, and human with a penchant for feasting on human flesh. Its distinctive tail is festooned with large quills like those of a porcupine, which the manticore flings at prey by whipping its tail like a sling. These deadly spikes give the manticore the power to slaughter even well-armed warriors from the safety of the sky.</div><div><br /></div><div>Although the anthropomorphic face of the manticore suggests a keen intellect, most creatures of its kind are simple-minded killers. They can be clever liars, however, and their voices have a strangely musical sound that has lured many unwitting travelers into an ambush. A manticore discovered by uneducated humanoids (especially those who are both lawful and evil) can sometimes become the center of adoration and even worship; a manticore in this situation swiftly gives in to its laziness and allows its acolytes to bring it tribute in the form of food and treasure, feasting upon its own followers when offerings become scarce. Stronger humanoids who encounter a manticore can cow it through intimidation and violence, sometimes even forcing it into service as a mount. As long as the manticore is well fed with human flesh and its master leads it to victory, a manticore mount can prove surprisingly loyal.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Beast (Arcana, Nature): DC 18</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LE, Large, Beast, Skirmisher, Elite</strong></div><div>Perception +10; darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet</div><div>Languages Common</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +4, Athletics +10, Intimidation +5, Survival +6</div><div>Str +5, Dex +2, Con +4, Int -2, Wis +2, Cha -1</div><div><strong>AC 20; Fort +10, Ref +10, Will +7</strong></div><div><strong>HP 70 (starts with 30 temporary hit points)</br></strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet, fly 40 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reactions:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//attack-of-opportunity" target="_blank">Attack of Opportunity</br></a></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Melee </br>jaws +11 [+6/+1], Damage 2d8+7 piercing</li>  <li>Melee </br>claw +11 [+7/+3] (agile), Damage 2d6+7 slashing plus <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//grab-monster-ability" target="_blank">Grab</a></br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Melee Tail Stab (one action): The Manticore stabs a creature it has grabbed, automatically dealing 2d8 piercing damage, and injecting the creature with <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//giant-scorpion-venom" target="_blank">Giant Scorpion Venom.</a></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Ranged </br>spike +10 [+5/+0], (range increment 40 feet), Damage 2d8+7 piercing</li>  <li>Spike Spray: The Manticore sprays a wide spray of spikes into a 30 foot cone, 6d8 damage (useable once per 24 hours).
