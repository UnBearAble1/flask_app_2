</br><h1>Lampad</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 7</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Lampads protect dark, hidden places underground. Not only do they defend subterranean caverns from threats, but they also safeguard well-meaning innocents from the dangers that lurk below the surface. Lampads are so-named for the wisps of magic light they often carry, guiding the lost to safety while luring threats to their doom. Lampads' mercurial nature makes their reactions difficult to predict, though they rarely demonstrate outright malice without sufficient provocation.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CN, Medium, Earth, Fey, Nymph, Controller</br></strong></div><div>Perception +10; darkvision</div><div>Languages Aklo, Common, Sylvan, Undercommon</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +11, Athletics +7, Diplomacy +11, Nature +6, Occultism +7, Performance +10, Society +7, Stealth +11</div><div>Str +0, Dex +5, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +3, Cha +5</div><div><strong>AC 19; Fort +8 , Ref +10 , Will +12</strong></div><div><strong>HP 42; Weaknesses cold iron 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 25 feet, climb 25 feet (on stone only)</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>:</br></div><div>Cavern Dependent: A lampad is mystically bonded to a single cavern or other self-contained underground area and must remain within 300 feet of it for more than two minutes. If they move beyond that range, they become sickened 1 and are unable to recover. They must attempt a DC 13 Fortitude save every hour or increase the sickened value by 1 (to a maximum of sickened 4). After 24 hours, they become drained 1, with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours. A lampad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond to a new cavern.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Earthen Fist; Melee Single Action: +9 (+5 / +1) </br>(agile, finesse), Damage 2d4+7 bludgeoning</li>  <li>Light Wisp; Ranged Single Action: +10 (+5 /+0) (magical, range increment 30 feet), Damage 2d6+7 mental plus 1d6 fire and 1d6 positive</li>  <li>Primal Innate Spells DC 22</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Expert: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/shape-stone" target="_blank">shape stone</a>; <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/meld-into-stone" target="_blank">meld into stone </a>(at will), <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/pummeling-rubble" target="_blank">pummeling rubble</a> x2;</li>      <li>Trained: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/faerie-fire" target="_blank">faerie fire</a>, <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/heal" target="_blank">heal</a>;</br></li>      <li>Cantrips <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/dancing-lights" target="_blank">dancing lights</a></li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Weep Single Action (auditory, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) Frequency once per round; Effect The lampad begins a heart-wrenching fit of weeping, inspiring sympathetic sobbing in nearby creatures.
