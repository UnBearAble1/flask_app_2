If the next action you use is to cast <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/harm" target="_blank"><em>harm</em></a> targeting one undead creature, you transform the effects of that harm spell. Instead of harm's normal effects, the target becomes controlled by you if its will save DC is 2 levels worse than your spell DC. It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being controlled by you. If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.</div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</li>  <li>Success The target is unaffected.</li>  <li>Failure The undead creature becomes a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/minion" target="_blank">minion</a> under your control. The spell gains a duration of 1 minute, but it is dismissed if you or an ally attacks the minion undead.</li>  <li>Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.</li></ul></div>
