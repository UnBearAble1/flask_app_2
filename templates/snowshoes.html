They are typically made with a wood frame and rawhide lacings that are tied over the wearer's other footwear. While wearing snowshoes, you ignore the effects of non-magical <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//difficult-terrain" target="_blank">difficult terrain</a> caused by snow (reducing greater difficult terrain from snow to ordinary difficult terrain). You take a -10-foot item penalty to your Speed if wearing snowshoes while walking on any surface other than snow.</div></div>
