</br><h1>Quoppopak</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 8</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Quoppopaks combine the most terrifying aspects of water striders, octopuses, and vampire bats into one evil, water-dwelling monster. Their bodies consist of an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey's mouth and is capable of intaking fluids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land, they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can't expel fluids, it still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but they are located inside the creatures' abdomens, allowing them to draw their air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters' water reserves quickly deplete.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Aberration (Occultism)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CE, Large, Aberration, Aquatic, Brute</br></strong></div><div>Perception +10; low-light vision</div><div>Languages Aquan</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +12, Athletics +13, Stealth +13</div><div>Str +7, Dex +6, Con +5, Int -2, Wis +5, Cha +0</div><div><strong>AC 21; Fort +11, Ref +13, Will +9</strong></div><div><strong>HP 130</br></strong></div><div><strong>Speed 15 feet, swim 40 feet, water glide 30 feet</strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Water Glide The quoppopak can stand and move on the surface of water or other liquids without falling through.
