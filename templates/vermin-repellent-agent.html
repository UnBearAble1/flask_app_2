The repellent also binds with a number of common insect venoms, dulling the potency and giving the wearer's immune system a boost to resist venoms. Once applied to your skin, the repellent grants you an item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against poisons for 4 hours. In addition, any arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals) must attempt a Will save when attempting to attack you with a melee Strike, or with a swarm attack such as the spider swarm's swarming bites. The arthropod then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.</div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The creature can act normally.</li>  <li>Success The creature is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/frightened" target="_blank">frightened</a> 1.</li>  <li>Failure The creature is frightened 2.</li>  <li>Critical Failure The creature is frightened 2 and <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/fleeing" target="_blank">fleeing</a>.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>TRAINED</strong></div><div><strong>Price </strong>5 gp</div><div>You gain a +1 item bonus and the save DC is 15.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>EXPERT</strong></div><div><strong>Price</strong> 20 gp</div><div>You gain a +2 item bonus and the save DC is 17.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>MASTER</strong></div><div><strong>Price</strong> 35 gp</div><div>You gain a +3 item bonus and the save DC is 20.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LEGENDARY</br></strong></div><div><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp</div><div>You gain a +4 item bonus and the save DC is 23.</div></div>
