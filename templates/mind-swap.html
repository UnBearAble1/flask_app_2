</br><h1>Mind Swap</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>MASTER</strong></div><div><strong>Rare, Mental, Necromancy, Possession</strong></div><div><strong>Cast</strong> 1 day; <strong>Cost</strong> a pair of jeweled mirrors worth a total value of 250 gp per target;</br></div><div><strong>Secondary Casters</strong> 1 <strong>Primary Check</strong> Occultism (expert); <strong>Secondary Checks</strong> Medicine or Occultism <strong>Range</strong> 10 feet; <strong>Target(s)</strong> two creatures of the same type (though not necessarily the same ancestry) </br><strong>Duration</strong> 1 week</div><div><br /></div><div>This ritual allows two subjects to exchange minds, fully inhabiting one another's bodies. The two targets can be chosen from you, the secondary caster, or unrelated third parties present throughout the ritual. Normally, both targets must be of the same type (such as humanoid, dragon, or undead) for the minds to be fully compatible, but at the GM's discretion, for a much higher cost, the targets can be different types; </br>When both targets are of the same ancestry, muscle memory and the influence of their soul allow them to carry over all their mechanical abilities into each new body. If they are different ancestries, they adopt the ancestry feats of the other body (even behavioral skills, which are adopted as muscle memory and instincts.)</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If a body dies, the mind and spirit controlling it dies instantly. When the spell ends, the minds and souls snap back to their original bodies. At this time, if the original body is dead, the mind and soul attempting to return to that body die as well.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success: Each target's mind and spirit possess the other's body and can control it normally. The mind swap is unusually smooth, and the targets gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//impersonate" target="_blank">Impersonate</a> each other.</li>  <li>Success: Each target's mind and spirit possess the other's body and can control it normally.</li>  <li>Failure: The ritual has no effect.</li>  <li>Critical Failure: The ritual is scrambled, sending a welter of confused memories into the target's minds. You and the secondary casters are <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//stupefied" target="_blank">stupefied</a> 2 for the next week.</li></ul></div>
