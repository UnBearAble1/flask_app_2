Those are typically:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Harmed By: Non cantrip spells of this element or type deal the amount of damage listed in this field. If the golem is threat level 5+, the spell type must be expert or above. If the Golem is threat level 9+, the spell must be master or above.</br></li>  <li>Healed By: Non cantrip spells of this element or type heal the Golem the amount of damage listed.</br></li>  <li>Slowed By: Non cantrip spells of this element or type give the Golem the slowed 1 condition. If successfully struck by three or more spells of this type in a single round, it is slowed 2 (successfully struck meaning the spell would have otherwise done damage).</br></li></ul></div>
