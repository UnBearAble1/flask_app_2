You spend 10 minutes considering two different leads you're pursuing. You then attempt a check to investigate how connected the two are. Unless the GM determines otherwise, this is a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//crafting-int" target="_blank">Crafting</a> check if they're both items or a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//society-int" target="_blank">Society</a> check for other combinations of leads. If any subjects are creatures, this check usually uses the highest DC among their Deception and Will DCs. If no subjects are creatures, but at least one is an item, the DC is usually a hard DC for the tier of the highest-tier item. If neither case applies, the DC is usually an expert or master DC. Once you try to Connect the Dots between two particular leads, you can never try to Connect the Dots between those same leads again unless the GM allows it after you've learned a substantial amount of new information.</div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The GM tells you how connected the two leads are to one another: highly connected, somewhat connected, tangentially connected, or not connected. The GM also tells you one specific way in which they're connected, if they are.</li>  <li>Success As critical success, but the GM doesn't tell you a specific connection.</li>  <li>Failure Your results are inconclusive.</li>  <li>Critical Failure You misconstrue the information. As success, but the GM provides an incorrect degree of connection.</li></ul></div>
