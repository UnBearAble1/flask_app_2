</br><h1>Ricochet Stance</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>3 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Warrior; Ranged Weapons<br /></br>1 Action; Stance; Prerequisites Expert in Warrior</strong><br /></br>You adopt a stance designed to rebound your thrown weapons back toward you. While you are in this stance, any thrown weapons you use as part of a ranged <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> to deal bludgeoning or slashing damage immediately return to your hand, enabling you to use them for additional Strikes. You must be within the weapon's listed range increment and have a hand free to catch the weapon. If you make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon outside of its listed range increment, it instead flies back toward you a number of feet equal to its listed range increment and then falls to the ground.</div></div>
