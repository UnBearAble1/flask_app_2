Allies within the area gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against emotion effects. An ally can touch the font as an Interact action; if they do so, the spell attempts to counteract one emotion effect affecting the ally of the ally's choice, after which that emotion effect is temporarily immune for 1 day. If the spell succeeds at the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/counteracting" target="_blank">counteract</a> check, it removes the emotion effect from your ally, though not from any other creatures the effect might be affecting.</div></div>
