</br><h1>Incapacitation</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it's harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell or effect </br>has the incapacitation trait, then creatures with defense rankings of a higher tier than the effect, or any creature with a Threat rating of 8 or higher, also treat their result as one one degree better.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>For example, <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/baleful-polymorph" target="_blank">Baleful Polymorph</a> is a Master tier spell with the incapacitation trait, and requires a fortitude saving throw to resist. Any creature with a Legendary fortitude save would treat their saving throw result as one degree better against this spell. Meanwhile, <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/blindness-6255307" target="_blank">Blindness </a>is an Expert tier spell that requires a fortitude save, so any creature with a Master or higher fortitude spell would treat their saving throw result as one degree better against the spell.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Remember that any spellcaster can heighten any spell to a higher tier by casting it at that increased difficulty, which may allow them to overcome this trait's limitations.</br></div></div>
