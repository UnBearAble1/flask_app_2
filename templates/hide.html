The GM rolls your <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//stealth-dex" target="_blank">Stealth</a> check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you're observed by but that you have cover or greater cover against or are <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a> from.
