It gains the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/quickened" target="_blank">quickened</a> condition and a +1 to AC for 1 round. If the target or one of their allies within 20 feet gets a critical success on an attack roll against a significant foe, whoever got the critical success becomes quickened (and gains the +1 to AC) if they weren't already, and the duration of the winning streak is extended by another round. Creatures quickened by the spell can use the extra action to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a>, <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/step" target="_blank">Step</a>, or <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/stride" target="_blank">Stride</a>. If a full round passes without the target or one their allies critically succeeding on an attack roll against a significant foe, the winning streak breaks and the spell ends.</div></div>
