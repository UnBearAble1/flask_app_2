</br><h1>Adamantine Golem</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 9</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Crafted from a nigh-indestructible metal of great rarity, adamantine golems can't be destroyed except by the most powerful foes. Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane of Earth, or an Outer Plane.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Construct (Arcana, Crafting)</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Huge, Construct, Golem, Mindless, Brute</br></strong></div><div>Perception +11; darkvision</div><div>Skills Athletics +18</br></div><div>Str +9, Dex -1, Con +9, Int -5, Wis +0, Cha -5</div><div>AC 22; Fort +14, Ref +10, Will +12</div><div><strong>HP 185 (repair mode); Immunities bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, fire, healing, magic (see below), mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious; Resistances physical 20 (except vorpal or adamantine)</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 30 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/golem" target="_blank">Golem Antimagic</a>: harmed by acid (5d10, 2d10 from areas or persistent damage); healed by fire (area 2d10 HP); slowed by electricity</li>  <li>Repair Mode: When the adamantine golem is at 0 HP, it isn't destroyed. Instead, it enters repair mode, during which it is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/slowed" target="_blank">slowed</a> 1, can't take reactions, and can take only the Self-Repair action. Once it has more than 30 HP, it can use any type of action and can use reactions, though it remains slowed 1 and can't take any reactions until the start of its next turn. If a critical hit with an adamantine or vorpal weapon reduces the golem to 0 HP, or if such a weapon hits it while it's already at 0 HP, then the golem is destroyed.</li>  <li>Vulnerable to Dispelling: The golem can be targeted by disjunction and dispel magic. If targeted by such a spell of Legendary Tier, the golem has its resistance to physical damage lowered to 15 and is slowed 1 (or slowed 2 if in repair mode) for 1d4 rounds. During this time, if the golem is reduced to 0 HP while already in repair mode, it is destroyed.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Fist -- Melee Single Action +12 [+7/+2] (deadly 2d12, magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 2d12+9 bludgeoning plus destructive strike</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Destructive Strike On a critical hit, the adamantine golem's fist Strike breaks the target's armor, if any, in addition to dealing damage to the target.

A creature can try to bar the way by attempting a DC 21 Fortitude save.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>Critical Success: The creature takes no damage and its armor takes no damage.</li>      <li>Success: The golem halts its movement and cannot enter the creature's square.</li>      <li>Failure: The resisting creature is damaged and its armor takes damage as if hit by the adamantine golem's fist.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Self-Repair: Single Action; (manipulate) The golem repairs itself, regaining 30 Hit Points.</li>  <li>Vent: Single Action; (fire) The golem vents a 30-foot cone of superheated steam from its internal forge. This deals 12d6 fire damage to all creatures in the cone (DC 21 basic Reflex). The golem can't use Vent again for 1d6 rounds.</li></ul></div>
