If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores 10 points of the target's resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the wall created by wall of fire. A creature's immunities are unaffected.</div></div>
