The first creature to enter the square or open the container must attempt a DC 18 Reflex save as the area is showered with bright, glittering dust that sticks to skin, fur, and clothing.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected.</li>  <li>Success The creature takes a -1 status penalty to Stealth checks for 1 minute or until it uses an Interact action to remove the glitter.</li>  <li>Failure The creature takes a -2 status penalty to Stealth checks for 2 minutes or until it spends a 2-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove the glitter. If the creature was <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//invisible" target="_blank">invisible</a>, the glitter outlines it for 1 round, making it <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a> rather than <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//undetected" target="_blank">undetected</a> to visual senses.</li>  <li>Critical Failure As failure, but the penalty is -4. The glitter sticks for 5 minutes or until the creature spends a 3-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove it. The glitter continues to fall around the creature until completely removed, leaving a trail behind it as it moves and revealing its rough location; the creature is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//hidden" target="_blank">hidden</a>, rather than undetected, to any creature that can see the glitter whenever it would otherwise have been undetected.</li></ul></div>
