When the casting is complete, you know whether that item is magical, and if it is, you learn the school of magic.</div><div><br /></div><div>If your read aura would foil an illusion by revealing it is illusion magic, the GM will make a secret spellcasting check for you vs the effect. On a failure, you know it is magical, but misread the school of magic. On a critical failure, you don't detect the magic at all. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are read normally.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
