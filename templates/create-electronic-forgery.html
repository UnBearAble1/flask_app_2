This process usually takes from a day to a week, and will likely require something to copy or base your work off of. You don't make a check at the time. Instead, whenever someone (or a system) reads the forgery, you make a check versus their Computers or Investigation skill DC.</br></div><div><br /></br>Success: The observer does not detect the forgery.</div><div>Failure: The observer knows your document is a forgery.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
