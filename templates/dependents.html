You may only risk harm to them if something very important (such as the safety of many other people) is at stake.</br></li>  <li><strong>Loved one [x2]:</strong> The Dependent is a relative or a lover. You may not put anything before their safety!</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Note</strong>: It may seem like an advantage to have a fairly capable ally who is nearly always around. You may even feel great about supplementing skills you don't have with a few on your ally. Bear in mind that the DM is obligated to use this Ally against you occasionally. They will end up getting you into trouble, stumbling into situations out of their control, or be used against you, and their protection cannot be simply guaranteed with a hand-wave or trick of circumstance.</br></div><div><br /></div></div>
