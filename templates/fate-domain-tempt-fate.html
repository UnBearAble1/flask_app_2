The target gains a +1 status bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion.<br /></br><br /></br>If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails, but you don't expend the Focus Point for Casting this Spell.</div></div>
