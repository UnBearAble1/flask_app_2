The point value of this complication is based on what form of pacifism you have:</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Reluctant Killer: [-1 pt]</strong> You can't stand taking life. You can commit acts of violence, but if it is lethal, and you can see your target's face, you are -4 to the rolls. If you can't see their face, you are -2. You have no penalty for abstract attacks that might kill, such as shooting a fireball into a building when you don't actually see people, or against creatures that clearly are monstrous or non-sapient. Should you ever kill someone personally, even accidentally, you will become depressed 2 for 2d6 days.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Cannot Kill: [-3pts]</strong> You can't kill at all, even in self defense, nor can you kill in non-direct ways, such as leaving someone to die of their own wounds. You must also do your best to prevent others from killing as well. If you ever accidentally kill anyone, you become depressed 3 for 2d6 days.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Cannot Harm Innocents: [-2 pts]</strong> You can start violence, but can only attempt to kill others who mean to do you serious harm (not capture you, knock you out, etc). You never intentionally do anything that causes, or even threatens to cause, injury to the uninvolved - particularly if they are "ordinary folks."</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Self-Defense Only: [-3 pts]</strong> You only fight at all if defending yourself or others. You do not fight for any other reason, and must try to discourage others from fighting as well!</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Total Nonviolence: [-6 pts]</strong> You can never perform violence of any kind, and must encourage others to not be violent as well.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
