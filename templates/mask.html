The plague mask attempts to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//counteracting" target="_blank">counteract</a> any inhaled poisons or airborne diseases each round you breathe. The same replacement filters used in <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//water-purifier" target="_blank">water purifiers</a> can be used with a plague mask, granting you the counteract modifier and effects of the filter for 20 minutes.
