</br><h1>Animal Companions</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Some adventurers travel with loyal allies known as animal companions and familiars. The former begin as young animals but acquire impressive physical abilities as you level them up with feats, while the latter share a magical bond with you.</div><div><br /></div><div>Your animal companion has the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//minion" target="_blank">minion</a> trait, and it gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//command-an-animal" target="_blank">Command an Animal</a> action to command it; this is in place of the usual effects of Command an Animal, and you don't need to attempt a Nature check.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If your companion dies, you can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no cost. You can have only one animal companion at a time.</div><div><br /></div><div>You or an ally can ride your animal companion as long as it is at least one size larger than the rider. A companion can only use its land speed (and even then, that is halved) while carrying a rider. It also cannot use its Support Ability while carrying a rider. The Mount special feature reduces some of these restrictions.</br></div><div><br /></br>Typically when you get the Animal Companion ability (usually through the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//animal-companion" target="_blank">Animal Companion</a> feat) your companion begins as a Young Animal Companion. Additional feats may transform the companion into a Mature Animal Companion or further into an Incredible Animal Companion. These changes increase the stats and capabilities of the companion, as outlined in the appropriate feats.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>When you first gain a Young Animal Companion, it's base abilities are determined by whether you choose a Brute Companion or a Skirmisher Companion (this choice cannot be changed later):</br></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">BRUTE COMPANION </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>Size: Medium or Large</div><div>Perception +7; low-light vision</div><div><strong>Languages</strong>: -</br></div><div><strong>Skills</strong>: Acrobatics +3 (trained), Athletics +6 (expert) </br></div><div><strong>Saves</strong>: Fortitude +8, Reflex +6, Willpower +5</br></div><div><strong>AC</strong> 16, </br><strong>HP</strong> 65</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Melee Single Action, Primary Attack +7 [+2/-3] Damage 2d8+3</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">SKIRMISHER COMPANION</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>Size: Small or Medium</div><div>Perception +7; low-light vision</div><div><strong>Languages</strong>: -</div><div><strong>Skills</strong>: Acrobatics +6 (expert), Athletics +3 (trained)</div><div><strong>Saves</strong>: Fortitude +6, Reflex +8, Willpower +5</div><div><strong>AC</strong> 18, <strong>HP</strong> 50</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>Melee Single Action, Primary Attack +7 [+2/-3] Damage 2d8+1</li>  <li>Melee Single Action, Secondary Attack (finesse, agile) +7 [+3/-1] Damage 2d6+1</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Your companion has a lot of elements that require your customization, the first of which is it's appearance. Work with your GM for what is appropriate for the setting, but know that your companion's appearance does not impact its in-game statistics (unless the GM determines in some cases it should to preserve immersion, such as requiring a companion with a climb speed to have some explanation for how it can climb.) These selections, normally, cannot be changed later.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Step One: Size:</strong> The first element to choose is your companion's size (Medium or Large for Brute, and Small or Medium for Skirmisher.)

Until the start of your next turn, if you hit and deal damage to the target, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//sickened" target="_blank">sickened</a> 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure). The DC is 18, or 20 if they are a specialized companion.</br></li>  <li><strong>Maimer</strong>: Your companion tears tendons with each opening.
