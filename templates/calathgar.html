</br><h1>Calathgar</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 4</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A calathgar's blue flowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.</div><div><br /></div><div>Calathgars' psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly flawless memories and can share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on information by speech. While calathgars themselves can't speak, they can typically be reasoned with--though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Plant (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Small, Cold, Plant, Soldier</br></strong></div><div>Perception +7; darkvision, scent 30 feet</div><div>Languages Sylvan; can't speak</div><div>Skills Stealth +9, Survival +6</div><div>Str +2, Dex +5, Con +2, Int -2, Wis +2, Cha +2</div><div><strong>AC 19 ; Fort +9 , Ref +7 , Will +5</strong></div><div><strong>HP 48; Immunities cold; Weaknesses fire 5, slashing 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 20 feet, climb 20 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Cold Healing: Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar would take cold damage, it instead regains 1d6 Hit Points (regardless of the amount of damage the cold effect would have caused). In severe cold or colder environments, calathgars gain fast healing 1.</li>  <li>Mold Mulch: When a calathgar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately decays and dies, transforming into a 5-foot patch of mold (or a 10-foot patch of mold if it was killed by fire damage). This patch of mold persists for 1 minute, during which time it deals 3d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn in this area, or 1d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn in an adjacent square. The mold patch decays away after an hour, but it can be destroyed before then (treat each 5-foot square as an object with Hardness 0, 10 Hit Points, BT 5, immunity to cold, piercing, and slashing damage; the mold deals half its regular cold damage once it's broken).</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Flower; Melee Single Action: +8 (+3 / -2) </br>(finesse), Damage 2d6+4 bludgeoning plus 1d6 cold</li>  <li>Tendril; Melee Single Action: +8 (+4 / +0) </br>(agile, finesse), Damage 2d4+4 slashing plus 1d6 cold</li>  <li>Seed Spray; Two Actions (cold, evocation, primal) The calathgar expels thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot cone, dealing 1d6 piercing and 4d6 cold damage (DC 17 basic Reflex save). In mild cold or colder environments, these seeds cling to living creatures they strike, dealing 1d4 persistent cold damage. The calathgar can't use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.</li></ul></div>
