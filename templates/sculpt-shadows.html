</br><h1>Sculpt Shadows</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>5 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Natural Abilities; Shadows</strong></div><div><strong>3 Actions; Conjuration, Occult, Shadow</strong><br /></br>You coax nearby shadows into the shape of a simple weapon or a simple tool or item, using a tiny piece of your shadow to make it solid; in doing so, you lose 1 Hit Point. You can create only common, non-consumable weapons, or adventuring gear with no intricate parts, written text, or other complicated components and up to Bulk 2. The item lasts until used for a single activity, until you Sculpt Shadows again, or for 1 minute, whichever comes first. Once the duration expires, the object dissipates, and you regain the lost Hit Point unless the item was Broken or Destroyed. As the object holds a tiny sliver of your shadow, you can't recover the lost Hit Point until after the object dissipates.</div></div>
