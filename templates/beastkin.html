</br><h1>Beastkin</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>3 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Physiology; Beastkin</strong></div><div>Choose a type of animal. This is the type of animal tied to your heritage and is known as your inherent animal. You gain the beast and beastkin traits, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You gain the Change Shape ability.</div><div><br /></div><div>Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance, and most beastkin remain in their hybrid shapes by default. In hybrid shape, you appear as a mix between your common ancestry heritage (human, elf, dwarf or the like) and your inherent animal.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>You may split your ancestry complications between your humanoid and hybrid forms, and they only apply to that form, but the ancestry feats they paid for also only apply to that particular form. For example, if your Beastkin form has &quot;Weakness: Silver 10&quot; gained from a 2-point <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//vulnerability" target="_blank">Vulnerability</a> complication, and you used that 2 points to pick up the 2-point <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//intimidating-mein" target="_blank">Intimidating Mien</a> ancestry feat - then both the vulnerability AND the benefit of Intimidating Mien only apply when you are in your hybrid form.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If you purchase any natural weapons, and they only apply to your hybrid form, reduce their <em>base</em> point cost by 2 (this only applies once per set of natural weapons), with a minimum cost of 1.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>You gain the following action: <br /></br><br /></br><strong>Change Shape, 1 Action; Concentrate, Polymorph Primal, Transmutation</strong><br /></br>You change into your humanoid or hybrid shape.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="line"><hr line-style="thick" /></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Boost: (+2 points): Myriad Forms.</strong> With a bit of self-discovery, you find a new form. You gain the alternate humanoid form of a different ancestry other than your own, adding it to the options for your Change Shape. You may again split your ancestry complications and feats to this new form as well.</br></div></div>
