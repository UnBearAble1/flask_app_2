The only <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//strike" target="_blank">Strikes</a> you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the forceful, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 item bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//shove" target="_blank">Shoved</a> or <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//trip" target="_blank">Tripped</a>. However, you have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5 feet. The item bonus to AC from Mountain Stance is cumulative with armor bonuses you get from magical clothing.</div></div>
