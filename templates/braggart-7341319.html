</br><h1>Braggart</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>1 Point</strong></div><div><strong>Professional; Fortune</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: Trained in Professional</strong></div><div><br /></br>You declare a boast about a particular skill action, such as Balance, Demoralize, or Recall Knowledge. The first time you attempt this action within the next minute in a context the GM deems both suitably challenging and meaningful, you have disadvantage on the roll. If you succeed at this check, you then gain advantage on the next two attempts at the same action for the next hour.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If you fail the first check, or either of the two subsequent checks, or don't attempt the action within the next hour, you instead take a -1 circumstance penalty on checks to attempt the same action until your next daily preparations (and cannot use Braggart until then). <br /></br><br /></br>If the chosen action can be used with multiple skills, such as Identify Magic or Recall Knowledge, you must specify which skill you are using for that particular action, such as using Arcana to Identify Magic, and your bonus or penalty after the boast applies only to checks using that skill for that action. Once you declare a boast about a particular action, you cannot declare a boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check.<br /></br><br /></br>Typically a challenging task is one with at least an expert DC, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action's success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals, rather than a boast you made simply to gain a bonus later.</div></div>
