Like for an <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/senses" target="_blank">imprecise sense</a>, you don't learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).</div><div><br /></div><div>You can choose to ignore magic you're fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.</div><div><br /></div><div>If your detect magic would foil an illusion by revealing it is illusion magic, the GM will make a secret spellcasting check for you vs the effect. On a failure, you detect it as magic, but not as illusion magic. On a critical failure, you don't detect the magic at all. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.</div></div>
