For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield, or an alchemist's lab to produce alchemical items.</li>  <li>You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item's Price.

This requires you to include the raw materials for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must complete the batch all at once. You also Craft non-magical ammunition in batches, using the quantity listed in the Ranged Weapons table (typically 10).</div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Getting Formulas</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>It's assumed any trained crafter knows how to craft ordinary objects, within the limit of reason as determined by the GM. See the Alchemical, Magical, and Snare crafting feats for how many formulas you can begin with for those types of crafting.</br></br></div><div><br /></div><div>Although formulas for crafting Snares and mundane items can typically be purchased or learned, due to the personal metaphysical nature of crafting alchemical or conduits, these must be learned the hard way, just like feats or other abilities. See <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/learning-epiphanies-and-experience-points" target="_blank">Learning, Epiphanies, and Experience Points.</br></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Formulas are instructions for making items with the Craft activity. You can usually read a formula as long as you can read the language it's written in, though you might lack the skill to Craft the item.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>A purchased formula is typically a schematic on rolled-up parchment of light Bulk. Once you have a formula, you can memorize it as a 4 day downtime activity, or use it directly to start crafting. Formulas for uncommon items and rare items are usually significantly more valuable--if you can find them at all!</div><div><br /></div><div>If you have an item, you can try to reverse-engineer its formula. This uses the Craft activity and takes the same amount of time as creating the item from a formula would. You must first disassemble the item. After the base downtime, you attempt a Crafting check against the same DC it would take to Craft the item. If you succeed, you Craft the formula at its full Price, and you can keep working to reduce the Price as normal. If you fail, you're left with raw materials and no formula. If you critically fail, you also waste 10% of the raw materials you'd normally be able to salvage.</div><div><br /></div><div>The item's disassembled parts are worth half its Price in raw materials and can't be reassembled unless you successfully reverse-engineer the formula or acquire the formula another way. Reassembling the item from the formula works just like Crafting it from scratch; you use the disassembled parts as the necessary raw materials.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
