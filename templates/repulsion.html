When casting the spell, you can make the area any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you cast the spell or as soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply only if it voluntarily moves toward you. For example, if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success The creature's movement is not restricted.</li>  <li>Success The creature treats each square in the area as <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//difficult-terrain" target="_blank">difficult terrain</a> when moving closer to you.</li>  <li>Failure The creature can't move closer to you within the area.</li></ul></div>
