</br><h1>Stumbling Stance</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>7 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Warrior; Ki Arts<br /></br>1 Action; Stance; Prerequisites trained in Deception; Powerful Fist</strong><br /></br>You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriated--bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/feint" target="_blank">Feint</a>. The only Strikes you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.</div></div>
