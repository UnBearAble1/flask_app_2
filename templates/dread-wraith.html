</br><h1>Dread Wraith</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 7</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel greater distances to sow terror or amass influence, often sticking to dark glades or sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly malevolent goal--such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life--might draw several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Undead (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LE, Large, Incorporeal, Undead, Wraith, Lurker</strong></div><div>Perception +11; darkvision, lifesense 60 feet</div><div>Languages Common, Necril</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +10, Intimidation +12, Stealth +10</div><div>Str -5, Dex +6, Con +3, Int +3, Wis +4, Cha +6</div><div><strong>AC 20; Fort +8, Ref +12, Will +10; +1 status to all saves vs. positive</strong></div><div><strong>HP 80 (negative healing); Immunities</strong> death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious; <strong>Resistances</strong> all 10 (except force, ghost touch, or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical)</div><div><strong>Speed fly 60 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Draining Presence (aura, negative) 10 feet.

The target wraith dissolves and streaks toward the dread wraith in a straight line, dealing 6d10 negative damage to each creature along the line (DC 21 basic Fortitude save). The dread wraith absorbs the essence of the target wraith, becoming quickened and gaining a +10-foot status bonus to its fly Speed for a number of rounds equal to the level of the absorbed wraith. It can use its extra action only to Fly or Strike. An unwilling target can attempt a DC 21 Will save to resist being absorbed.</li></ul></div>
