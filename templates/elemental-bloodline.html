</br><h1>Elemental Bloodline</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>13 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Spellcaster; Magical Bloodine</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: Trained in Spellcaster (Primal)</strong><br /></br>A genie ancestor or some other elemental influence has imbued your blood with primal fury, affecting how the bloodline spells and granted spells marked with an asterisk (*), as well as your blood magic, function.. Add the following spells to your repertoire, even if they aren't normally part of the primal tradition (note you must still have the appropriate level of spellcaster proficiency to cast the spell):</div><ul></br>  <li>cantrip: produce flame*,</li>  <li>Trained: burning hands* and resist energy,</li>  <li>Expert: fireball* and freedom of movement,</li>  <li>Master: elemental form and repulsion,</li>  <li>Legendary: energy aegis and prismatic wall,<br /></br></li></ul><div>Whenever you cast a spell from the list of spells above, gain the following Blood Magic ability: Elemental energy surrounds you or a target. Either you gain a +1 status bonus to Intimidation checks for 1 round, or a target takes 2 damage per spell tier level. The damage is bludgeoning or fire, according to your elemental type (see below). If the spell already deals that type of damage, combine it with the spell's initial damage before determining weaknesses and resistances.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>*Choose the type of elemental that influenced your bloodline: air, earth, fire, or water. If your element is air, you buffet your foes with powerful winds; if it's earth, you toss huge chunks of rock; if it's fire, you incinerate your foes with flame; and if it's water, you inundate your foes with torrents of water. For fire, all marked spells deal fire damage. For other elements, they deal bludgeoning damage. You replace any existing elemental traits with the trait of the element you chose</div></div>
