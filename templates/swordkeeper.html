While the swordkeeper is operational, the chamber requires four successful DC 20 Thievery checks to Disable a Device to open; on a critical failure, the backlash deals 6d6 force damage (DC 21 basic Reflex save) to the creature attempting the check. If the swordkeeper is immobilized, grabbed, prone, or stunned, both DCs are reduced by 2. If the weapon is removed, the swordkeeper's echoblades vanish.</div><div><br /></br><strong>Reaction</strong>:</br></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/attack-of-opportunity" target="_blank">Attack of Opportunity</br></a></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Echoblade; Melee Single Action: +11 (magical, reach 10 feet, versatile P), Damage 1d8+7 slashing plus 1d8 force</li>  <li>Fist; Melee Single Action: +11 (agile, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d6+7 bludgeoning</li>  <li>Thrown Echoblade; Ranged Single Action: +11 (agile, magical, thrown 30 feet), Damage 1d6+7 slashing plus 1d8 force</li>  <li>Colossal Echo: Two Actions (force) Requirements The swordkeeper has a central weapon; Effect The swordkeeper projects a massive echoblade held in all four hands, dealing 6d8 force damage to all creatures in a 30-foot line (DC 21 basic Reflex save).
