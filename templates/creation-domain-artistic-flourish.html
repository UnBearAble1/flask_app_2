The item grants a +1 item bonus to attack rolls if it's a weapon or skill checks if it's a skill tool. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously temporary, so its monetary value doesn't change.<br /></br><br /></br>When you cast this spell, any previous artistic flourish you had cast ends.</div></div>
