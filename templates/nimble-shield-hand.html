</br><h1>Nimble Shield Hand</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>4 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Warrior; Shields</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites: Master in Warrior</strong><br /></br>You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even while using the hand that's holding it for other purposes. The hand you use to wield a shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the Interact action. You can also hold another object in this hand (but you still can't use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn't apply to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome.</div></div>
