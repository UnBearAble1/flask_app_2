Sometimes that makes them let go, and sometimes it just makes them angrier, but either way, it's both satisfying and tasty. Make a Bite attack against the triggering foe. On a critical hit, you are no longer grabbed. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</div><div><br /></div><div>*At the DM's discretion, any other feat or ability that allows you to attack with a bite will work for the prerequisite.</br></div></div>
