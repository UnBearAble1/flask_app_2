Its appearance transforms as flames erupt from its skin, a whorl of negative energy surrounds it, or poison leaks from its flesh. When you Mount your steed ally, you can choose fire, negative, or poison. As long as you ride it, your steed gains resistance 10 to the chosen damage type, and any creature that touches your steed takes 1d6 damage of the chosen type; this includes hitting the steed with unarmed attacks or with a melee weapon Strike while adjacent to the steed.</div></div>
