When you Cast this Spell, choose a destination you know the approximate location of. You receive an inspired route to that destination, knowing how to get there and allowing you and allies who travel overland with you to reduce the movement penalty from <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/difficult-terrain" target="_blank">difficult terrain</a> by half for the duration, as long as you don't deviate from the inspired route. This doesn't have any effect on movement during encounters. If you use this ability again before the duration is over, this effect ends and is replaced by that of the new route.</div></div>
