</br><h1>Train Animal</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>1 Point</strong></div><div><strong>Nature; Animals</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisites trained in Nature</strong><br /></br>You spend time teaching an animal to do a certain action. You can either select a basic action the animal already knows how to do (typically those listed in the <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//command-an-animal" target="_blank">Command an Animal </a>action) or attempt to teach the animal a new basic action. The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time the training takes (usually at least a week). It's usually impossible to teach an animal a trick that uses critical thinking. If you're expert, master, or legendary in Nature, you might be able to train more unusual creatures, at the GM's discretion.</div><ul></br>  <li>Success The animal learns the action. If it was an action the animal already knew, you can Command the Animal to take that action without attempting a Nature check. If it was a new basic action, add that action to the actions the animal can take when Commanded, but you must still roll.</li>  <li>Failure The animal doesn't learn the trick.</li></ul></div>
