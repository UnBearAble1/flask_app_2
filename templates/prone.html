You can Take Cover while prone to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).</div><div><br /></div><div>If you would be knocked prone while you're Climbing or Flying, you fall (see Falling for the rules on falling).
