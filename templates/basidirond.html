</br><h1>Basidirond</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat 5</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls about on woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral-rich moisture---whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood---for sustenance. It uses hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs nearly 300 pounds when saturated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Fungus (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Medium, Fungus, Mindless, Controller</br></strong></div><div>Perception +8; low-light vision, tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet</div><div>Skills Athletics +9, Stealth +9</div><div>Str +4, Dex +4, Con +4, Int -5, Wis +1, Cha -3</div><div><strong>AC 17; Fort +6 , Ref +8 , Will +10</strong></div><div><strong>HP 30; Immunities cold, mental; Weaknesses slashing 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 20 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>:</br></div><div>Cold Lethargy Although a basidirond is immune to cold damage, any effect that deals cold damage causes it to become slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds.

Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or experience powerful hallucinations as long as it remains in the cloud, plus an additional 1d4 rounds after leaving the area. A creature must attempt a new save each round it remains effected. The cloud persists for 5 rounds unless dispersed before then by a strong wind. Each hallucinating creature rolls 1d6 each round to determine what it hallucinates that round.</br>    <ul></br>      <li>1 The target is sinking in quicksand.
