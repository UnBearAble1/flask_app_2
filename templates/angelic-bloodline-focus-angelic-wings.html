Each round this is in effect, you gain a fly speed equal to your speed, but it ends at the end of the round and you begin to fall - gliding down 60 feet (you take no damage if you hit the ground.) Your wings cast bright light in a 30-foot radius. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//feather-fall" target="_blank">feather fall</a>.<br /></br><br /></br>Additionally, immediately upon casting this spell, until the end of your next turn, an angelic aura grants you a +1 status bonus to saving throws for 1 round.</div></div>
