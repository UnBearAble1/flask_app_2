When you are in a triggering situation, you must make a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//all-about-complications" target="_blank">self-control check </a>or start to hear them. Triggering situations are as follows:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>You are in a stressful situation</br></li>  <li>You critically fail a willpower saving throw</br></li>  <li>You fail another self control roll for a different complication</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>The Point value of this complication is based on the severity:</br></div><ul></br>  <li><strong>Annoying [-1 pt]</strong> You hear voices, but you are reasonably sure that they are not real, and they do not harm you directly. Still, most people who see you responding to unheard noises will have <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//all-about-complications" target="_blank">-2 to reaction rolls.</br></a></li>  <li><strong>Disturbing [-2 pts]</strong> As above, but in addition, the voices can drown out normal sounds, and may even startle and frighten you (usually involving an expert willpower save to avoid becoming <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//frightened" target="_blank">frightened</a>).</br></li>  <li><strong>Diabolical [-4 pts]:</strong> The voices tell you to kill - yourself or others - or perform other terrible deeds. If you are already under stress, or under the influence of drugs, you might need to make an expert willpower save to avoid carrying out the "orders" (GM's discretion).</br></li></ul><div><br /></div></div>
