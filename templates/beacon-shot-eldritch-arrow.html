You must shoot the ammunition before the end of your turn or the magic dissipates.<br /></br><br /></br>When an activated beacon shot hits a target, it embeds itself into that target and spews sparks for 1 minute. If the target is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/invisible" target="_blank">invisible</a>, it becomes merely <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/hidden" target="_blank">hidden</a> to creatures who would otherwise be unable to see it. The sparks also negate the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/concealed" target="_blank">concealed</a> condition if the target was otherwise concealed. A creature can remove the arrow or bolt by using an Interact basic action and succeeding at an Athletics check. The DC is your tradition skill DC (occultism, arcane, nature, or religion) or spellcasting DC. The arrows revert back to normal arrows after a minute once fired.</div></div>
