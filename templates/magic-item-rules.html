</br><h1>Magic Item Rules</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Aside from <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//alchemical-items" target="_blank">Alchemical items</a>, there are four types of magic items in this game: Tokens, Scrolls, Relics, and Artifacts.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">TOKENS AND RELICS</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Tokens</strong> are items imbued with the latent magic siphoned from objects rich in it. They are single-use magical items that characters will encounter regularly, </br>collecting as many as they carry and are encouraged to use them often.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Any character can have 3 tokens on their person, plus any additional number based on their Warrior or Professional class skills, with no issue. Carrying more beyond that causes a risk of a mystical backlash. For each hour they carry over their limit, the GM will roll a 30% chance, plus 20% per each additional token carried past their limit, to see if a backlash occurs. Backlashes have two effects:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>A random carried token is immediately is used, with the carrier as the target.</br></li>  <li>A magical backlash occurs, as per a critical failure when <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//spellcasting" target="_blank">spellcasting.</br></a></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Relics</strong> are incredibly rare, very difficult to craft, yet permanent magic items.</br>These are items that Legends tell of: a chalice that will heal the land, a sword that will cut through steel, a ring that will render one invisible.The real root of the power of a Relic is actually the Shard (see Crafting below) and it is actually possible to transfer the shard from a Relic into another item, transferring the magical ability as well.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Relics are effectively living <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//ritual-rules" target="_blank">Rituals</a>, perpetually ebbing and flowing with magical energy, fueled by Shards and channeled using esoteric action. Unlike Tokens, can be reused, though typically require specific actions or prerequisites to unlock their potential, which varies greatly by Relic. For example, a living rope may require 'feeding' positive energy, or a diabolical sword may collect 'screams' that it can channel into sonic blasts.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Crafting Tokens</br>and Relics</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Though in some extremely rare occasions Tokens are naturally occurring, either as a part of a magical creature, or through a place high in planar convergence, typically they (and Relics) are crafted. There are three primary components in the crafting:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>A <em>shard</em>: An object containing latent magical energy</br></li>  <li>A <em>fetter</em>: A custom crafted device to house and direct the magical energy</br></li>  <li>The successful casting of the <em>Token Crafting Ritual </em>or the <em>Relic Crafting Ritual.</em></br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Tokens are immediately usable after the three steps above. Relics must be then house into an item fitted to use them in order to truly work. That will be explained further, below.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Shards</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>An object containing either latent magical energy, such as a part of a magical creature or piece of planar matter, or containing emotional magical energy from a significant event - such as a knife used in a truly lamentable mercy killing, the wedding ring lost by an ancient Queen in a falling out with her wife that led to the downfall of a kingdom, or the discarded holy symbol of a saint who fell from grace. Shards can be found with <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//detect-magic" target="_blank">Detect Magic</a> and <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//read-aura" target="_blank">Read Aura</a>, and are the power source for Tokens and Relics. These objects are naturally occurring, and impossible to predict or manufacture. Some events are simply the right combination of emotionally residual and historically significant, and one simply can't assume any particular object in that event will become a shard. In fact, almost always, the emotional residue must age - usually for decades - before coalescing into a useful shard.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="informative"><div class="info-container" info-color="orange"><div class="info-title">Reveal Shard's Nature: (Crafting, Arcana, Religion, Nature, or Occultism) </div><div class="info-content"><div>Once a crafter is aware of a shard's magical power, they can make a secret Crafting check (with a DC based on the potency of the shard) to understand the nature of the kind of token (or in much, much rarer situations, the Relic) that can be crafted from it. Regardless of your roll, you always know what tier of a Token or Relic that is crafted from the shard will be.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success: You have a very clear understanding of what kind of Token or Relic you will create (Example: This will create a token that will do great electricity damage in a 10 foot radius.)</br></li>  <li>Success: You have a vague idea of the kind of Token or Relic that will be crafted (Example: this will create an electricity based</br> offensive token)</li>  <li>Failure: You have no idea the kind of Token or Relic that will be crafted</li>  <li>Critical Failure: You have the wrong impression of the kind of Token or Relic that will be crafted.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Fetters</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Fetters are the magical housing, crafted by magical smiths, that envelop the Shard and focus its energy into its final effect.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Token fetters typically must be about the size of an apple. The token fetter shape, material and design is largely dependent upon the crafter and the needs of the Token, and always must include some or all of the Shard. Fetters are devices, and must include some method of mechanically activating the Token. You may craft, for example, a rune-engraved brass sphere with a clickable indentation in its surface, a strange bundle of glass tubing that can somehow twist in the middle, or a slender wand of fine oak with a small gemstone switch on the outside. When a Token is activated, the fetter breaks, losing all value. Token Fetters are crafted during the Token Crafting Ritual:</br></div></div><div data-component-type="informative"><div class="info-container" info-color="red"><div class="info-title">Token Crafting Ritual (Abjuration) </div><div class="info-content"><div><strong>Cast</strong> 1 day; <strong>Crafting components</strong> for the fetter equal to 5 gold pieces for Trained, 10 gold pieces for Expert, 20 gold for Master, and 50 gold for Legendary tokens; <strong>Secondary Casters</strong> 2; <strong>Primary Check</strong>: Crafting (requires tier of the token); <strong>Secondary Checks</strong>: Arcane, Crafting, Religion, Nature or Occultism</br></div><div><br /></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//ritual-rules" target="_blank">Ritual Rules.</br></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Once a magic crafter has a shard and reveals its nature,</br> they can begin to craft all or part of it (depending on the nature of the shard) into a token fetter. In the final stages of crafting the fetter, the secondary casters of the ritual begin to focus on pulling the latent magical energies into it. The primary caster gets a +1 to their roll if they have firm details about the shard (typically by making a critical success on their Reveal Nature check), a -1 if they have no idea, or a -2 if they have the wrong idea.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success:</br> You craft a truly exceptional Token. It works to the optimal possible effect, and has a small enhancement (typically the DC to save against is 2 higher, or some area or duration is extended by 10%)</br></li>  <li>Success: You craft the token as intended.</br></li>  <li>Failure: You craft the token, but it is weaker than it could have been (typically the DC to save against is 2 lower, or some area or duration is reduced by 10%).</br></li>  <li>Critical Failure: You fail to craft the token, and each caster suffers a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//spellcasting" target="_blank">magical miscas</a>t as per a critical failure on spellcasting as the magic of the shard backlashes into the world. The shard and fetter are destroyed.</br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Token Rules for the GM </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div>Tokens that deal damage or have combat effects, should be fairly on par for spells by tear. In fact, damaging spells make a great resource for creating combat tokens in general, especially if you trade up certain elements. For example, a Trained-Tier Token could be a modified version of Burning Hands- maybe a token that emanates crushing sadness, making it a 15ft cone that deals 7d6 mental damage with a basic willpower save, or a Master-Tier Token could be a modified Disintegrate that is actually a token made from an explorer who froze to death: 120ft Range, 10d10 cold, destroys objects by freezing them solid and shattering them. Non damaging combat spells could work too - an expert tier Token that can mirror Heroism would grant it a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks for 10 minutes.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Non combat or utility tokens can run the gamut of abilities, but should always introduce something interest that can change an encounter, scene, or even storyline in unpredictable ways. The more complex, powerful, or permanent effects are the greater the tier.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you need ideas for tokens, consider simply lifting them directly from spells, feats, or magic items from other games. In fact, since the idea for tokens was inspired by Numenera's Cyphers, that's a great place to look for inspiration.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Here are some example tokens:</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Trained Tier:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The Springboard: This token, when activated and dropped on the ground (from any height) , creates a springboard surface with a 30 foot area that lasts for 10 minutes. Any creatures or objects that land on the surface take no damage from a fall (no matter how far they fell) and bounce up a third of the distance they fell (if they fell straight down, they usually land repeatedly on the springboard until they settle).</br></li>  <li>The Any Tool: When activated, this token permanently transforms into a non magical common or uncommon tool or kit with no more than 5 moving parts, no larger than 2 bulk.</br></li>  <li>The Drank: When activated, his item turns a pint of cold ale into a healing brew. Drinking the brew restores 2d6 hit points and provides enough nourishment for a single day.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Expert Tier:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The Scooner: When activated, the</br> token turns into a 15 foot long, 4 foot wide silver and pearl canoe. Massive feathered wings (15 feet long each) stretch from the craft, which can be piloted with a Trained DC Sailing Lore check or an Expert DC Athletics or Survival check. It has a fly speed of 200, and lasts for 1 hour.</br><br /></br></li></ul><div>Master Tier:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Detection-Proof: When activated, You can't be targeted by detection magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors for 1d6 days.</br><br /></br></li></ul><div>Legendary Tier:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Instant Cottage: When activated, this token becomes a permanent medium sized cottage furnished with common furnishings. The cottage includes a permanent foundation built into the ground it appeared on.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></div><div>Relic Fetters can be much smaller than Token Fetters, often around half an inch (1.27 cm). Unlike with tokens, the Relic Fetter isn't crafted as part of the Ritual, and must be crafted ahead of time. This requires an Extreme DC crafting check. The crafter gets a +1 to their roll if they have firm details about the shard (typically by making a critical success on their Reveal Nature check), a -1 if they have no idea, or a -2 if they have the wrong idea.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>The process takes a number of days of downtime based on the potency of the Relic. It also requires special materials with a gold piece value of 10x the number of days: </br></div><ul></br>  <li>Trained-Tier: 10 days</li>  <li>Expert-Tier: 50 days</br></li>  <li>Master-Tier: 100 days</br></li>  <li>Legendary-Tier: 500 days</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Once you have the custom crafted Relic Fetter, you can then fuse it with the shard using the Relic Crafting Ritual:</br></div></div><div data-component-type="informative"><div class="info-container" info-color="red"><div class="info-title">Relic Crafting Ritual (Abjuration)</div><div class="info-content"><div><strong>Cast</strong> 5 days; <strong>Secondary Casters</strong> 2; <strong>Primary Check</strong>: Crafting (requires tier of the final item); <strong>Secondary Checks</strong>: Arcane, Crafting, Religion, Nature or Occultism</br></div><div><br /></div><div><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//ritual-rules" target="_blank">Ritual Rules.</br></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Once a magic crafter has revealed a Shard as being capable of being crafted into a Relic, and have completely constructed the Relic Fetter, they can use this ritual to fuse the two. </br></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success:</br> You craft a truly exceptional Relic. It works to the optimal possible effect, and has a small enhancement (typically a +1 to certain types of rolls or DCs involved or increased duration or capability)</br></li>  <li>Success: You craft the Relic as intended.</br></li>  <li>Failure: You craft the Relic, but it is weaker than it could have been (typically the DC to save against is 2 lower, or its efficacy is reduced in some way).</br></li>  <li>Critical Failure: You fail to craft the Relic, and each caster suffers a <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//spellcasting" target="_blank">magical miscas</a>t as per a critical failure on spellcasting as the magic of the shard backlashes into the world. The tier of this effect is one higher than the tier of the Relic being crafted. If a Legendary Relic were being crafted, then each caster suffers two Legendary tier magical miscasts. The shard and fetter remain intact, however, and the ritual can be attempted again.</br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></br><strong>Reliquaries</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>When finally crafted, a relic is often a small object half an inch to a side - such as a marble sized sphere of intricately crafted iron, or a ritualistically oil-infused wooden cube the size of a small die. These potent items are not possible to use themselves, but must be fitted to specially crafted items known as Reliquaries.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Reliquaries are ordinary items, such as swords, rings, staves, or embroidered cloaks that have specially fitted slots designed to hold Relics. They have in them special components that give them the structural integrity and magical conductivity capable of channeling the incredible power of Relics into useful effects.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Reliquaries can be crafted in the same fashion as normal items of their type, but always require a Master or Legendary skill to do, and the tier of the crafted Reliquary determines the maximum tier of Relic it can support. Reliquaries also have an increased cost based on the number of Relics they can support:</br></div><div><br /></div><div>1 Relic: +50 gold pieces</br></div><div>2 Relics: +200 gold pieces</br></div><div>3 Relics: +700 gold pieces</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Weapons with extra Relic slots typically can have one in striking area, such as the blade, one in the hilt, and one in the cross-guard. This may limit the the type of Relics available for each section.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Relics can be removed from Reliquaries with a moderate DC crafting check of the appropriate tier of the Relic and a 1-hour activity. There are two downtime crafting actions that can be done to Reliquaries: </br></div></div><div data-component-type="informative"><div class="info-container" info-color="orange"><div class="info-title">Enhance Reliquary (Crafting) [Downtime]</div><div class="info-content"><div>You attempt to expand an existing Reliquary to have more Relic slots. This follows all the same rules as <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//craft" target="_blank">crafting</a> a new item, only the item's cost is the difference between its original cost and the new one. The DC is always a Hard DC for the tier of the original Reliquary.</br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Also:</br></div></div><div data-component-type="informative"><div class="info-container" info-color="orange"><div class="info-title">Affix Relic (Crafting) [Downtime]</div><div class="info-content"><div>You attempt to affix a Relic to a Reliquary. This requires tools, similar to the craft action, and often a workspace such as a forge or workbench. During this process you are typically modifying both the Relic and the Reliquary to make sure they can form a smooth connection. The DC is a Hard DC of the appropriate tier of the Relic.</br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">SCROLLS</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>A scroll contains a single spell that you can cast without having to make a spellcasting roll. A scroll can be Crafted to contain nearly any spell, so the types of scrolls available are limited only by the number of spells in the game. The exceptions are cantrips, focus spells, and rituals, none of which can be put on scrolls. The spell on a scroll can be cast only once, and the scroll is destroyed as part of the casting. The spell on the scroll is cast at a particular spell tier, as determined by the scroll. For instance, a scroll of magic missile (trained) can be used to cast the trained-tier version of magic missile, but not a magic missile heightened to expert tier. If no tier is listed, the scroll can be used to cast the spell at its lowest tier.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you find a scroll, you can try to figure out what spell it contains. If the spell is a common spell from your spell list or a spell you know, you can spend a single <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a> action and automatically succeed at identifying the scroll's spell. If it's not, you must use <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//identify-magic" target="_blank">Identify Magic</a> to learn what spell the scroll holds.</div><div><br /></div><div>Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal number of actions for that spell.</div><div><br /></div><div>To Cast a Spell from a scroll, the spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack roll and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).</div><div><br /></div><div>Any physical material components and costs are provided when a scroll is created, so you don't need to provide them when Casting a Spell from a scroll. You must replace any required material component for that spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a focus, you must have that focus to Cast the Spell from a scroll.</div><div><br /></div><div>All scrolls have the same base statistics unless noted otherwise. A scroll has light Bulk, and it must be held in one hand to be activated.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Crafting a Scroll</br></strong></div><div><br /></div><div>If you have the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//magical-crafting" target="_blank">Magical Crafting</a> feat, you can craft a scroll using the normal <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//craft" target="_blank">crafting rules</a>. When you begin the crafting process, choose a spell to put into the scroll. You have to either Cast that Spell during the crafting process, or someone else must do so in your presence. Casting that Spell doesn't produce its normal effects; instead, the magic is trapped inside the scroll. The casting must come from a spellcaster succeeding or critically succeeding in a spellcasting roll and following all the normal spellcasting rules. </br>You can't Craft a scroll from a spell produced from another magic item, for example. The caster has to provide any cost of the spell.</div><div><br /></div><div>Like other consumables, scrolls can be crafted in batches of four. All scrolls of one batch must contain the same spell at the same tier, and you must provide one casting for each scroll crafted.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the purposes of crafting, and possibly purchasing in-world, the costs of scrolls are:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Trained: 30 gold</br></li>  <li>Expert: 60 gold</br></li>  <li>Master: 100 gold</br></li>  <li>Legendary: 200 gold</br></li></ul></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">ARTIFACTS</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Artifacts are the closest thing to "perpetual" magic items. They are built using complex rituals that create permanent conduits to other planes of existence. These devices are always massive, usually the size of a person or larger, as the mechanisms to create them are extremely complex and difficult to maintain, and difficult if not impossible to move. Relics take years, even decades or centuries to craft, and are inordinately expensive. They are often only located in palaces, arcane academies, great churches and the like.</br></div></div>
