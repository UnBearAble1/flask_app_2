</br><h1>Creation</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><br /></div><div><strong>Activation: Duration</strong></div><div><strong>Linked Skill: Crafting</strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: Touch</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>You have the ability to create something out of nothing. Typically, this is limited to matter, wind, or fire. Creating anything else is typically covered by exceptional edge cases listed in other effects.</br>Create Material has the following rules and restrictions:<br /></br></div><ul></br>  <li>Your creation never fulfills a material cost</li>  <li>Your creation cannot be made of precious materials or uncommon materials, or, if it is, those materials are obvious fabrications that cannot be sold or passed off as genuine.</br></li>  <li>By default any item you make that would have artistic or crafting quality is either automatically detected as a magical fabrication (which intrinsically is off-putting enough to sapient creatures to disqualify it as 'art' or give it value.) If you instead make an appropriate check using a relevant skill you have, that represents the artistic quality of your creation.</br></li>  <li>You cannot create a solid object in such a way that it envelopes a creature or object fully, without leaving it at least 5 feet of space on 3 sides. If you are still able to fully envelope a creature (with 5 feet of space on three sides), it still gets a Reflex save. On a success, it moves to the nearest square to it that is adjacent to your creation. If your creation is so large that it is bigger than their speed, they are unable to get this saving throw. Note that this entire rule is about solid creations, not wind, liquid, fire or the like.</br></li>  <li>You can't uncreate an ability during its duration unless you also have the sustained or concentration limits.<br /></br></li></ul><div>Notes on Creating Shaped Non-Solids:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The default assumption is that any non-solid you create that otherwise wouldn't sustain a useful duration (such as creating wind or fire in an area that would otherwise dissipate) is magically shaped into the area and stays there. You can also pick this option for material that would still sustain a duration, but would suddenly spill out over a greater area (such as creating beer), but if you lack the dynamism of this ability to create various versions, you must select which version of the shaped area works for your ability when you create it: Does it obey normal laws of shape and matter, or does it always hold a fixed shape?</br></li>  <li>Other hostile effects: If you want your creation to actually deal damage or have special mechanical benefits beyond their interactions with the environment or being physical obstacles, you will need to add special attack or other effects to enhance them.</br></li>  <li>Non Solids do what they logically should do, most of the time, which is usually one or more things from this list:</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>Ignores flammable materials</br></li>      <li>Douses fires</br></li>      <li>Is difficult terrain</br></li>      <li>Must be swam through</br></li>      <li>Cannot be breathed in</br></li>      <li>Blocks vision partially (creatures are concealed in, or on either side of)</br></li>      <li>Blocks vision entirely</br></li>      <li>Muffles sound entirely</br></li>      <li>Blocks light projectiles through</br></li>      <li>Blocks gasses from going through</br></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Designing Your Creation Ability</strong></div><div></br></div><div>The base cost is based on the maximum <strong>hardness</strong> of the material you can create (pay for the most expensive option you can create only.)</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Non-Solids with 1 or 2 benefits from the list above: (Base: 3)</br></li>  <li>Flimsy (cloth, paper, etc) (Base: 3, Mod +2)</br></li>  <li>Non-Solids with 3 or 4 benefits from the list above: (Base: 3, Mod +3)</br></li>  <li>Non-Solids with 5+ benefits from the list above: (Base: 3, Mod +5)</br></li>  <li>Slightly Sturdy (Wood, Ice, Flesh) (Base: 4, Mod +6)</br></li>  <li>Sturdy (Stone) (Base: 8, Mod +6)</br></li>  <li>Incredibly Sturdy (Metal) (Base: 12, Mod +8)</br></li>  <li>Invulnerable (Force) (Base: 16, Mod +10)</br></br>    <ul></br>      <li>The movability of Force is that an object twice their size, but made of steel.</br></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Dynamics</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>You always create the same exact object, with the same exact measurements, though with GM approval you can alter it slightly to fit into a space (Base -8, Mod -2)</br></li>  <li>You always create the same type of object, though can alter its size, cosmetics, or measurements up to the maximum size you purchased (Base -8)</br></li>  <li>You always create similar categories of objects, such as 'walls' or 'furniture' but otherwise can use any combination of features you purchased (Base -4)</br></li>  <li>You can create any object that matches the features you purchased (default)</br></li></ul><div><br /></br><strong>Complexity</strong>:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Very simple, like a wall, a sphere, a block or other simple shapes</br> (Mod -2)</br></li>  <li>Simple, like a common tool, melee weapon, or piece of furniture with no moving parts, or plants. (default)</br></li>  <li>Moderate, like a common tool with 2-3 moving parts, or an object with designs, writing or art on it (Mod +2)</br></li>  <li>Complex, like a kit or complex object or tool, or very intricate or exact design of something (Mod +6)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Maximum Dimensions</strong> start at 1x1x1 foot. You can increase this per each of the three dimensions by increasing the cost. For each +1 to the three sides, increase the Mod by +2. So if you could create a 10x10x10 foot cube, that would be 9 increases, so an additional Mod +18.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Additionally, if your maximum size is 10x10x10 or larger, increase the Base by +4.</br></li>  <li>If your maximum size is 20x20x20 or larger, increase the Base by +8.</br></li>  <li>If your maximum size is 50x50x50 or larger, increase the Base by +12.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Special Modifications:</br></strong></div><ul></br>  <li>You can only have one created item in existence at one time. (Mod -6)</br></li>  <li>Sustenance: Food or drink you create with this power can be consumed for nutrition. The duration of this effect must be 24 hours or greater, and it cannot have a limit allowing you to end it early. Without this feature, even if you created food or drink it wouldn't provide any sustenance to the consumer. (Mod +5).</br></li>  <li>The object can be affixed to another object, even if normally not possible. This can't be used in combat (unless you combine this with a special attack for the effect you want) but could be used to create fire attached to an object (like making a burning torch),to affix a pulley to a wooden beam, or to affix a stone bridge into the ground for example. (Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>You can make a perfect replica of something (note, this doesn't change the fact that you can't create things with value, and upon close examination for an assessment of value, this falsehood is immediate.)</br> (Mod +2)</li></ul></div>
