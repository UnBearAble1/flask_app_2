When you use Dualistic Synergy, choose a damage type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. In addition to Dualistic Synergy's normal effect, a foe within 30 feet of you takes an amount of damage of the chosen type equal to 2x the spell's tier. If the spell already deals damage of the chosen type, combine the damage before applying weaknesses and resistances.</div></div>
