If you can cast a spell with the revelation trait that affects your senses, such as <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/see-invisibility" target="_blank">see invisibility</a>, while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/command-an-animal" target="_blank">Command an Animal</a> on the target as part of <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/sustain-a-spell" target="_blank">Sustaining</a> this Spell. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you Cast this Spell.</div></div>
