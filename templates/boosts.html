</br><h1>Boosts</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Boost further enhance the usability of your effects, improving upon their existing perimeters, removing barriers from them, or giving them entirely new options.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Boosts usually increase the Mod of the ability, but on rare occasions may either increase the Base or be their own new Base effect.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Boosts here are ranked from the lowest possible Mod to the highest.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Tier Mod +1</h2></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Alternate Linked Skill [Mod +8]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Available to: Any effect with an existing linked skill</br></div><div><br /></div><div>You can substitute a different skill for the linked skill on this effect.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Consumable Item [Mod +0 through +6] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Available To: Any activated effect <em>without</em> an unlimited duration.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Mod +0] <br /></br><br /></br>Your effect is only delivered via consumable items. By default, creating the item is a free action (unless you have other activation limits), you can only have 1 item in existence at a time, and it is potent until your next daily preparations. The item is an item, meaning passing it from one character to another still takes an interact action, and it follows all stowing and retrieving rules. </br>The item is 1L bulk. Using the consumable also takes 1 interact action, and the effect triggers when you do, including lasting for its normal duration.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If your effect has an instantaneous duration, then by activating the item the creature instantly receives the benefit.<br /></br><br /></br>If your effect is a special attack, they are usually bullets, bombs, magic wands, or poisons. Any creature using these to attack are considered specialized in them. </br>The way activations work for these is usually whatever makes the most sense for the item, but by default if you activate the item, you use the attack immediately. If you modify the number of actions the attack takes, this modification applies to the activator of the item, not your activation of it. To modify how long it takes you to make the item, use the &quot;Slower activation&quot; limit instead of the rules in Special Attack.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>You can have 2 items in existence at a time - though you still must still activated this effect as normal, creating a single item, including paying any costs or following any rules (Mod +2)</br></li>  <li>You can have 3 items in existence at a time - though you still must still activated this effect as normal, creating a single item, including paying any costs or following any rules (Mod +4)</br></li>  <li>Shorter Potency (Encounter: Until end of your next turn, Exploration: One Hour.) </br>(Mod -2)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Note: You can apply activation boosts and limits twice with a consumable item, specifying which apply to your creating the item and which apply to the user activating it.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Difficult to Identify [Mod +1 through +5] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Any ability that would identify the nature of your effect has reduced effect.</br>Note that some abilities may still be able to affect your effect (even dispel it) without identifying it.</br></div><ul></br>  <li>The penalty is -2 (Mod +1)</br></li>  <li>The check has disadvantage (Mod +3)</br></li>  <li>Your ability is impossible to identify (Mod +5)<br /></br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Includes Unknown Information [Mod +2] </h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>(Note: This boost has a strong intended spirit, and can be broken if applied incorrectly. Work with your GM on making sure your effect makes sense to use this on.)</br></div><div><br /></br>Your effect can impact specifics that you don't actually know, but this cannot give you knowledge you don't have. For example, if you wanted to build an ability that uses an Alter Matter effect to alter the words within a book to specifically find and replace one word for another word, without this boost you would need to manually go through the book and see each instance in order to effect it. This boost allows the power to 'magically know and find' those instances for you.<br /></br><br /></br>(Warning!) The spirit of this boost is for hand waving magical effects that otherwise would be impossible without the character explicitly taking the time to learn information or see minutiae. This boost cannot be used in a fashion designed to supply the character special insight they didn't have, or to allow for tactical gain that breaks line of effect.<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Increased Area Category [Base 4 and greater]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Available to: Any effect.

Some effects are worded such that they only affect you, so don't need range. If you want these to affect others, you'll need to buy that boost first, then you can increase its range with this one.<br /></br><br /></br>(See: <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//range-duration-and-area" target="_blank">Range, Area, Duration</a>)<br /></br></div><div>Per each category increase: Mod +4</div><div><br /></div><div>Increase your range by one category.

Typically, this overcomes one or more of the following:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Effects the fire trait cannot normally be used underwater</li>  <li>Creatures normally have 5 fire resistance against fire effects</br></li>  <li>Ranged Slashing or Bludgeoning effects cannot function normally<br /></br></li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Tier Mod +2 </h2></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Add Password [Mod +4]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Available to: any non-attack effect with a duration longer than 1 round.<br /></br><br /></br>You can embed the ability for creature of your choice to temporarily disable or bypass your effect by speaking a password.

If your ability requires activation, you may choose another target than yourself that you can touch when activating the ability. You can increase your range beyond touch with the &quot;Increased Range&quot; boost.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>Special Attacks: If you wish to grant creatures your instantaneous special attacks, this boost allows you to transfer your ability to attack to another creature that you can touch. They must use their own attack skill to attack with it. Only one creature may attack with your special ability each round, even if you modify this boost to include multiple targets. If your special attack specifically has the Adds to Strike, "Activated" version, then follow the rules above for Non Attacks. You can increase your range beyond touch with the &quot;Increased Range&quot; boost.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>If you apply an area, the default assumption is the ability is beneficial to all qualifying creatures in the area. You'll need to pick "Select Targets" options to avoid this.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Modifications to this Boost:</div><ul></br>  <li>You can never affect yourself, only others (Mod -8)</br></li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Concealable [Mod +10]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></br>Available to: effects that require some type of action or activation, and cannot be applied to attacks that deal damage</div><div><br /></div><div>You can attempt to conceal your usage of an effect. </br></div><div><br /></div><div>When activating your effect, you can attempt either a deception check (if it has the verbal component) or a stealth check (If it has the somatic component, or neither component), or both (if it has both the verbal and somatic components) against any observers' perception DC.</br><br /></br><br /></br>If you succeed, then you weave your actions into appropriate actions for the situation. You may, for example, weave a charm spell into a normal conversation - which may be critical unless you rapidly speed up activation times.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>This ability hides only your actions and manifestations, not your feat's effects, so an observer might still see a ray streak out from you or see you vanish into thin air. Further, some abilities may exist that specifically counter this concealment. It only applies to visual and audio elements. A creature that could see magic, for example, still may see magic being worked around you.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Modification:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Instead of requiring a check, the effect is automatically hidden unless observing creatures can obviously guess via context clues, then they can make an appropriate Recall Knowledge check. (Base +4)</br></li>  <li>Instead of completely concealing your effect entirely, you pass it off as a harmless (neither beneficial nor harmful) effect, but otherwise must still follow the base rules of attempting to do so (observers can still attempt a Recall Knowledge check to determine what it really was). An example would be activating a charm effect that you can pass off as activating the ability to detect truths.

Your effect is also centered on a single target within range, which could be either yourself, an object, or a single square (you must pick the type of object that the effect can be centered on when you build the ability.) In order for an applicable creature (including yourself) to gain the benefit of the effect, they must spend an action to interact with the font.

Typically this will be purely adjudicated based on the situation, but you may find that no matter how much damage you do with your club, the GM won't let you sever a rope with it. They may also decide that a torch, no matter how good you are with it, won't eventually burn through a stone wall. This is how the rules are intended to work. This boost, however, allows you to supersede that organic logic. Attacks with this boost can deal damage to matter using the standard rules of hardness and broken and destroyed thresholds no matter how illogical that seems.</br></br></br><br /></br><br /></br>Modification:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Can be done covertly and in a controlled fashion, possibly allowing you to attack matter quietly and discreetly.

There are two version of this boost:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Mental:</br> You can move the ongoing effect mentally. This requires 1 action with the concentration trait, and can move a default distance of 30 feet. Any of those things can be improved with boosts, but the maximum distance an effect can move with a single action is 120 feet. By default, this effect "teleports" from one location to the other, and isn't "Drug through" the spaces it moves through, unless the effect has no affect on creatures. (Mod +12)</br></li>  <li>Attached: When you activate this effect, it begins attached to an unattended object, a willing creature, or an object attended by a willing creature. When the creature or object moves, the effect stops working until the creature/object stops moving again, unless the effect has no affect on creatures. (Mod +14)</br><br /></br></li></ul><div>Modifications:</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Drags through spaces: This effect affects all the spaces it moves through if applicable (meaning, if simply touching the area is enough to trigger its outcome, then creatures or objects in the intervening space between where your area started and where it moves are affected.) (Mod +6)</br><br /></br></li></ul><div>Special Note: If you want your area to "Pull creatures along with it" - then you'll need to select the Special Attack feature "forced movement." The maximum distance a creature can be moved with it is equal to the lesser of that feature, or this one. However, you can choose to stop moving an area at any time, even after you learn that a creature isn't going to be forced to move along with it as far as you thought (because of a successful defense, for example.)<br /></br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Tier Mod +4</h2></div><div data-component-type="collapsible"><div><h4 class="collapsible-title">Trap [Mod +14]</h4><div class="collapsible-content"><div><br /></div><div>Available to: Special Attacks or activated non-attacks.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>You set this effect into the environment, where it lays dormant until triggered.
