</br><h1>What is this game?</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>The Pathfinder 2e Laz Cut is my take on Pathfinder 2nd edition. It's gritty, it has no character levels, and it is point-buy instead of class-based. There are countless possible character builds, thanks to the nearly 3,000 individual feats the game is made from, and this knowledge base has all of the rules you need to play contained therein.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Whether you've played a table top roleplaying game before or not, you can play this game. If you have played Pathfinder 2e before, you'll see quite a bit of change in this cut of the game compared to the core system - but the chassis is almost exactly the same. You'll see the same stats, concepts such as saving throws and hit points, rest mechanics and the like, but a lot of the specifics have been augmented.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="informative"><div class="info-container" info-color="green"><div class="info-content"><div>Don't assume that a rule will work exactly the same as it did in Pathfinder 2nd edition. Make sure to look up the new rule, just in case.</br></div></div></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="what-i-mean-when-i-say-gritty" level="4">What I mean when I say &quot;Gritty.&quot;</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>&quot;Gritty&quot; means more dangerous, even more lethal, with a higher focus on survival aspects when needed, reduced super-heroic powers that were assumed to be of easy access at certain tiers, such as flight, dark-vision, unlimited healing, teleportation, resurrection, and so on. What we have here isn't quite OSR, but it also isn't quite DnD/Pathfinder. It is designed for people who are looking for something between the two.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="what-i-mean-when-i-say-no-level" level="4">What I mean when I say &quot;No-level.&quot; </h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Many modern games, especially those like Pathfinder that are based on Dungeons and Dragons, insist upon the concept of a character growing in vertical power over time, like a video game (though, to be fair, video games likely got this from D&amp;D.) In principle, playing a character who is a fledgling adventurer with limited skills is not the worst premise, and also playing a seasoned master of their craft dominating world affairs can also be fun. These level-creep games usually have you grow from one to the other over the course of about a year or two in your character's life. Which is... weird.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Personally, I hate that concept. I prefer fiction - and notably, I think what I'm referring to is actually the majority of all action fiction - that is about a character who is already professionally capable, maybe even one of the best at their trade, and how they ply their skills to resolve problems in the story. Most action heroes tend have an arc of self-discovery or learning, they grow emotionally or spiritually, and rarely is the story about how they grow in their personal power and skill (especially at an alarming rate, like in DnD.) There are, of course, exceptions. Rand Al'Thor, Naruto, Kaladin Stormblessed, and Luke Skywalker are all characters who exist in stories about their own exploration of their powers and abilities. Meanwhile John Wick, Gimli son of Gloin, Conan the Barbarian, and Natasha Romanoff are all examples of the countless characters who don't go through a lot of vertical power growth.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>That said, I also acknowledge that getting new abilities in a game is fun. The solution here is that while your characters in the PF2E Laz Cut do not grow in vertical power, they grow <em>horizontally</em>. They do not continue to gain more and more bonuses to attacks, defenses, hit points, spell-power and the like, and instead continue to accrue points that are spent in new feats and abilities selected from the thousands of available feats in the game.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="what-i-mean-when-i-say-point-buy" level="4">What I mean when I say &quot;Point Buy.&quot; </h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>As stated above, your character is created from numerous pools of points, spent on abilities like spellcasting, saving throws, perception, skills, combat feats, skill feats and the like. This system has constrained spending and balance rails to make sure things don't go too far off the rails, but is designed for an extraordinary amount of creation freedom. You will begin by selecting your attributes from an array, then spending your ancestry points on ancestry points that best define your culture and physiology. Then you'll spend class points which establish levels of proficiency they have in the core principle of your class: Warrior, Spellcaster, Professional and Alchemist. Finally, you'll spend a pool of points on class and skill feats - which more clearly define what makes your character specifically unique.</br></div></div>
