If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result. If you have the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/glad-hand" target="_blank">Glad-Hand</a> feat, you don't take the penalty on your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is this type of creature.</br></div></div>
