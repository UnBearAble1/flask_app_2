In a stressful situation (but no more than once per hour of game time), make a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//all-about-complications" target="_blank">self control roll</a>. On a failure, another personality emerges, and you behave according to its mental complications and personality quirks. If there is more than one personality available, the DM will pick one relevant - or roll randomly.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Unfortunately, all of your personalities are somewhat shallow and affected, which gives you a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//all-about-complications" target="_blank">-1 to reaction rolls</a> with everyone. If someone sees your personality shift, you get a -3 with them (this may cause another reaction roll, and this roll can't improve their disposition.)</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Each of these personalities has its own ambitions, goals, and traits. Further, this allows you to have compartmentalized bundles of background complications. Though your maximum for background complications is still -10, and Split Personalities gives you -3 of those, up to -7 of the rest of your points can be set aside for your personalities. You then get that pool amount in different mental complications for each personality, even though you only get the points to spend of one of the personalities.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><em>Example: Ezberan has three personalities. Along with his Split Personality (-3), he also has Nearsighted (-4) the physical complication. This leaves him with a pool of -3 points for each of his 3 personalities. He selects the following for each:</br></em></div><ul></br>  <li><em>Ezberan the Well Versed, who has Librarian's Code of Honor (-1), Curious (-1), Easy to Read (-1),</em></li>  <li><em>Colonel Ezberan, who has Bad Temper (-2) and Callous (-1)</em></li>  <li><em>Crazy Ezzie, </br>who has Lunacy (-2) and Loner (-1)</br></em></li></ul><div><em>Even though he each of his personalities has 3 points of distinct complications, he only &quot;gets&quot; 3 points to spend from all the personalities complications combined (plus his -7 from Split Personality and Nearsighted, for a total of -10)</br></em></div></div>
