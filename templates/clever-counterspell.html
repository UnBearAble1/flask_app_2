Instead of being able to counter a foe's spell with Counterspell only if you have that same spell in your repertoire, you can use Counterspell as long as you have the spell in your tradition. When you use Counterspell in this way, you must know a spell that shares a trait other than its tradition with the triggering spell. At the GM's discretion, you can instead use a spell that has an opposing trait or that otherwise logically would counter the triggering spell (such as using a cold or water spell to counter fireball or using remove fear to counter a fear spell). Regardless of what spell you expend, you take a -2 penalty to your counteract check, though the GM can waive this penalty if the expended spell is especially appropriate.</div></div>
