On a critical hit, you are no longer grabbed.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+3 Points)</strong> Sharp Teeth: Your teeth are formidable weapons. Your bite attack damage increases to 2d8 piercing damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+1 Point)</strong> Swinging Bite: You can swing your head and slash with your teeth (or beak) when piercing attacks won't do. Your bite unarmed attack gains the versatile S weapon trait.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+1 point)</strong> Sawtooth: bite unarmed attack gains the</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//deadly" target="_blank">deadly</br></a>d8 trait.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+2 points)</strong> Hungry: Whenever you critically succeed on an attack with your bite, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount you rolled on your damage dice until the end of your next turn.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+2 points)</strong> Gnaw: With enough time and determination, you can chew through nearly anything. For three actions, you deal double your jaws damage to an unattended, inanimate object. You also take no damage for attempting to bite through hard materials.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+2 Points)</strong> Taste Blood: You gain the Taste Blood Action</div><ul></br>  <li><strong>1 Action; Necromancy, Negative</strong></br>    <ul></br>      <li>You drink fresh blood from a living humanoid creature, gaining 5 temporary hit points that last for 10 minutes. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save become</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//drained" target="_blank">drained</br></a>1. Regardless of the outcome of this save, the target is temporarily immune to your Taste Blood for 1 day; further uses of this ability against the target don't increase the drained condition or grant you more temporary Hit Points.</br></li>      <li>To drink a creature's blood, either your last action must have been a Bite attack that damaged the target, or the target must be restrained or unconscious and your last action must have been a Strike that dealt piercing or slashing damage to them. If the target is willing, they don't need to be restrained or unconscious for the latter. Draining the life force from an unwilling humanoid creature is a greater violation than just drinking their blood. Taste Blood has the evil trait unless the target is willing or is an active foe in combat.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
