During umbral extraction's duration, you can use the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/steal" target="_blank">Steal</a> action to attempt to take one of the foe's spells </br>instead of an item. You can also make one attempt to Steal as part of Casting umbral extraction. If you succeed at your check to Steal a spell, you deal 2d4 mental damage to the target per tier of the spell stolen due to the psychological toll of the spiritual emptiness created by wrenching the spell away. They are -4 to cast the spell, and you gain the temporary ability to cast that spell yourself, with a +2 bonus to do so. It gains the shadow trait if cast.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Determine the stolen spell at random from the target's spells that are the same tier as umbral extraction, or from spells one tier higher if you got a critical success. If the target has no spells of that level, use the highest tier below that in which the target does have a spell slot. (If the target has no eligible spells, you get nothing, but you can continue to attempt to Steal spells for the remaining duration.) You can't steal a target's innate spells, focus spells, or cantrips. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>As normal, you can Steal only from a target within your reach. Once you've, you can't attempt to Steal more spells. If you succeed at your <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/thievery-dex" target="_blank">Thievery</a> check, you must take the spell you stole, and you may only cast the spell once. When umbral extraction ends, you lose the ability to cast the spell. When you cast umbral extraction, any previous casting of umbral extraction currently affecting you ends.</div></div>
