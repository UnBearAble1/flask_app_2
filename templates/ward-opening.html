When you cast Ward Opening, select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature opens the object without speaking the password, alarm sends your choice of a mental alert (in which case the spell gains the mental trait) or an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains the auditory trait). Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up. A creature aware of the ward must succeed at a Stealth check against the spell's DC or trigger the spell when opening the object.</br></div></div>
