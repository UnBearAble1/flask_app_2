It also attempts to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//counteracting" target="_blank">counteract</a> any magical fires in its area. Both of these effects happen when the spell is cast and whenever a fire enters the wall's area. If the wall fails to counteract a given fire, it can't counteract that fire for the duration of the spell.</div><div><br /></div><div>Bludgeoning or slashing projectiles can't pass through the wall, and piercing projectiles have their range increments halved if they pass through the wall. A creature traversing the wall of water needs to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//swim" target="_blank">Swim</a> through. The rules of aquatic combat apply to creatures traversing the wall of water, targeting creatures within the wall, or passing through the wall. For instance, a bludgeoning or slashing melee attack targeting a creature in the wall would take a -2 circumstance penalty.</div></div>
