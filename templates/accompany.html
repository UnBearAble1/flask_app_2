If you succeed at the Performance check, your ally doesn't need to spend the focus points.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If the triggering ally is attempting to cast a Spell using Spellcasting, you attempt to channel the spell energy for them. Make a spellcasting check of the same DC the caster would have, but using your total Performance skill modifier (with a maximum value equal to the spellcaster's Spellcaster bonus.) You take all of the results of the Spellcasting roll, including any miscast surges and accumulated strain.</br></div></div>
