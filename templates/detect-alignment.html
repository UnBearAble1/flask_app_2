For example: a good creature who does good only when the opportunity presents itself (they see a creature suffering, so they do what they can to help alleviate it) would have a faint aura, where as one who dedicates their life to seeking out good to do would have a powerful aura. The auras of undead, clerics and other divine spellcasters with a patron deity, and creatures from the Outer Sphere are one step stronger than normal.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Objects and spells use the alignment of the creature responsible for them, and are often matched with the power of the item or spell. </br></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
