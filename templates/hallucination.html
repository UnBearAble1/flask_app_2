You choose which of these effects applies, and you determine the specifics of the hallucination. For example, you could make the target see all elves as humans, be unable to detect the presence of their brother, see their beloved pocket watch on their person even when it isn't, or see a tower in the center of town.</div><div><br /></div><div>The target can attempt an initial Will save, with effects below.

For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve the hallucination each time they interacted with an elf, bumped into their brother accidentally, tried to check their pocket watch, or studied the tower.
