</br><h1>Wound Thresholds and Healing</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div>Your character's hit points represent their ability to withstand aggregate damage over time, their vigor and fighting spirit, and their ability to stay conscious and avoid serious wounds in the heat of combat. Some wounds, however, go beyond simple hit point damage, possibly leaving characters with permanent changes.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="wound-thresholds" level="3">Wound Thresholds</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>Your character has a secondary stat called their &quot;Wound Thresholds.&quot; This stat is actually two numbers. The first number is equal to 1/3 their total hit points, rounded down. If your character ever takes this amount of damage at one time, they gain a Serious Wound (see random hit locations.) The second number is equal to 1/2 their total hit points. If they take this total or more, </br>they gain a Grievous Wound.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If a character ever takes so much damage at once that it would not only reduce them to 0 hit points, but would theoretically reduce them to a negative value greater than their total hit points, they are die instantly.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="wound-effects" level="3">Wound Effects</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>When a character takes a Serious or Grievous wound, it typically includes a set of penalties that are immediately applied to the character. These penalties remain until the wound is healed, and some of effects remain permanently (though the wound itself is considered healed) unless certain magical healing is applied (you can't regrow your severed arm, for example, using bed rest.)</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If a character is reduced to 0 hit points, they immediately gain a serious wound and are <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//death-dying-and-recovery" target="_blank">unconscious and dying</a>.</br>Their dying value begins at the number of wounds they currently have.</br></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="recovering-hit-points-and-healing-wounds" level="3">Recovering Hit Points and Healing Wounds</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>There are a number of spells and items that restore hit points, including the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//administer-first-aid-8413834" target="_blank">Administer First Aid </a>action from the Medicine skill. Completing a full rest will also restore a number of hit points to a character equal to their CON + 5.</br></div><div><br /></br></div><div>To heal and remove Wounds, however, is a bit more difficult. There are three ways:</br></div><ol></br>  <li>Rest and time. Assuming a character doesn't suffer a complication for an untreated wound (see below), Wounds will possibly go away with time. After completing their 4th full rest with a Serious Wound, a character can attempt a DC 15 flat check to see if the wound heals. They repeat this check every full rest afterward until it does so. Grievous Wounds follow the same rule, but characters cannot attempt their first flat check until after their 14th full rest.</br></li>  <li>Perform Surgery. Use of the Medicine skill's <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//perform-surgery" target="_blank">Perform Surgery</a> action can remove Wounds.</br></li>  <li>Magical Effects. Any feat, spell or item (unless otherwise specified) of Master-Tier that restores hit points will also remove a single Serious Wound, or reduce the natural healing time of a Grievous Wound down to 4 full rests. Legendary-Tier effects will remove a single Grievous Wound or two Serious Wounds outright.</br>Even if an effect heals more than once (once per round, or fast healing, for examples) the whole spell or ability's use is considered as a single healing for purposes of how many wounds it can heal.</br></li></ol><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="untreated-wounds-and-complications" level="3">Untreated Wounds and Complications </h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><div>If a character receive any wounds, they must be tended before the character rests if they wish guaranteed natural recovery. Any magical healing, no matter which category they apply to, will function enough to consider your wounds as tended. </br>Any successful use of <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//administer-first-aid-8413834" target="_blank">Administer First Aid</a>, <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//stabilize-injuries" target="_blank">Stabilize Injuries</a>, or <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//perform-surgery" target="_blank">Perform Surgery</a> will also qualify.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>If your character does nothing to tend their wounds and injuries, then when they next take an extended rest, they must make a flat check to see if their injuries give rise to a complication. Roll a flat DC 8 (+2 per Wound sustained).</br></div><ul></br>  <li>Critical Success: You are under no further risk of complications, and heal normally.</br></li>  <li>Success: You suffer no complications for this rest, but the next full rest roll again. You heal normally this time.</br></li>  <li>Failure: You suffer a complication. Not only do you not heal this night, you suffer 1d6 points of damage to the wound.</br></li>  <li>Critical Failure: You suffer a major complication. You cannot heal until your wounds receive medical attention (natural or magical), and you take 1d6 damage per day until they do.</br></li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
