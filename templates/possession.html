You ride along in the body while the spell lasts.</li>  <li>Failure You possess the target and take partial control of it. You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might control the target. At the start of each of the target's turns, it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it's <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//controlled" target="_blank">controlled</a> by you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.</li>  <li>Critical Failure You possess the target fully, and it can only watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//controlled" target="_blank">controlled</a> by you.</li></ul></div>
