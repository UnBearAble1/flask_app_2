The target takes 2d8 persistent bleed damage. The target becomes <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a>, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.</div></div>
