The book remains raised until the start of your next turn. While you have a book raised, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and a +1 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge to identify creatures using a skill related to the subject of the book. This bonus is in addition to any item bonus the book normally gives to the check.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you have <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//shield-block" target="_blank">Shield Block</a>, you can use the tome for that feat (Hardness 3, HP 12, BT 6) as though it were a shield. Whenever you use an ability that allows you to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//raise-a-shield" target="_blank">Raise a Shield</a>, such as Emergency Targe, you can Raise a Tome instead, changing any requirements that normally require a shield to apply to your book.</div></div>
