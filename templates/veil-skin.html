Changing from a disguise used to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/impersonate" target="_blank">Impersonate </a>back to your true appearance is a 3-action activity for you; if you're an expert in Deception, it's a 2-action activity, and if you're legendary in Deception, it takes only a single action. This doesn't allow you to don or remove armor or other equipment any faster, but your physical appearance otherwise returns to its normal state.</div></div>
