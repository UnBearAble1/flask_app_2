Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. Chromatic wall can't be <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/counteracting" target="_blank">counteracted</a> normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's level is lower than that of chromatic wall.</div><ul></br>  <li>1: Red The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/cone-of-cold" target="_blank">Cone of cold</a> can counteract a red chromatic wall.</li>  <li>2: Orange The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/gust-of-wind" target="_blank">Gust of wind</a> can counteract an orange chromatic wall.</li>  <li>3: Yellow The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic effects from passing through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/disintegrate" target="_blank">Disintegrate</a> can counteract a yellow chromatic wall.</li>  <li>4: Green The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/enfeebled" target="_blank">enfeebled </a>1 for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the enfeebled condition on a success. <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/passwall" target="_blank">Passwall</a> can counteract a green chromatic wall.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Heightened (Legendary) The spell's duration increases to 8 hours.

A red, orange, yellow, or green wall deals an extra 10 damage.</div><div><br /></div><ul></br>  <li>5: Blue The wall stops auditory, petrification, and visual effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of flesh to stone. <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/magic-missile" target="_blank">Magic missile</a> can counteract a blue chromatic wall.</li>  <li>6: Indigo The wall stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of warp mind. <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/searing-light" target="_blank">Searing light </a>can counteract an indigo chromatic wall.</li>  <li>7: Violet The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal).
