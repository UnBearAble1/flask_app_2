The spirit wisp makes a melee wisp rush unarmed attack against an enemy within 120 feet of you. The wisp's attack modifier is exactly equal to your normal preferred weapon attack, and it applies the same circumstance and status bonuses and penalties that you have. On a hit, the wisp deals damage equal to 2d8 plus your Constitution modifier. The damage is your choice of negative or positive damage; don't apply your Rage damage or your weapon specialization damage, but circumstance and status bonuses and penalties that would also affect the wisp's damage apply. If your wisp's Strike is a critical hit, the target becomes <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//frightened" target="_blank">frightened</a> 1. This attack uses and counts toward your multiple attack penalty as if you were the one attacking.</div></div>
