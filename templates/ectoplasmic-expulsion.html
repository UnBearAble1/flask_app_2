You immediately attempt to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/counteracting" target="_blank">counteract </a>any number of effects on the target with the emotion or possession trait, or an effect giving the target the <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/controlled" target="_blank">controlled </a>or <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/fascinated" target="_blank">fascinated </a>condition. If you fail to counteract the effect, you nevertheless set up a resonance that allows the target to more ably escape the effect on its own; for the next hour, the target gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves to shrug off the effect you failed to counteract (such as Will saves to shake off control by the possession spell).</div></div>
