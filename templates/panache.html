When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.<br /></br><br /></br>You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//tumble-through" target="_blank">Tumble Through</a> and additional actions determined by your panache style (below). At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically at master DC, but the GM can choose a different threshold).<br /></br><br /></br>While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//tumble-through" target="_blank">Tumble Through</a> or to take any actions that give you panache due to your panache style. When you have panache and you</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//strike" target="_blank">Strike</a></br>with an <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//agile" target="_blank">agile</a> or <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//finesse" target="_blank">finesse</a> melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 4 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a panache <em>finisher</em>, the additional damage is 4d6 precision damage instead. Finishers can only be performed if you have Panache, and doing so causes you to lose panache. <br /></br><br /></br>Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.</div></div>
