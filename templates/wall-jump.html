</br><h1>Wall Jump</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>5 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Athletics; Leaper</strong></div><div><strong>Prerequisite: Master in Athletics</strong><br /></br>You can use your momentum from a jump to propel yourself off a wall. If you're adjacent to a wall at the end of a jump (whether performing a <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/high-jump" target="_blank">High Jump</a>, <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/long-jump" target="_blank">Long Jump</a>, or <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/leap" target="_blank">Leap</a>), you don't fall as long as your next action is another jump. Furthermore, since your previous jump gives you momentum, you can use High Jump or Long Jump as a single action, but you don't get to <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/stride" target="_blank">Stride</a> as part of the activity. You can use Wall Jump only once in a turn, unless you're legendary in Athletics, in which case you can use Wall Jump as many times as you can use consecutive jump actions in that turn.</div></div>
