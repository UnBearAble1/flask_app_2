</br><h1>Weapon Critical Specialization Effects</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>AXE</strong>: Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage dice you rolled. This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>BOMB</strong>: Increase the radius of the bomb's</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/splash" target="_blank">splash</a></br>damage (if any) to 10 feet.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>BOW</strong>: If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/immobilized" target="_blank">immobilized</a> and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>BRAWLING</strong>: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/slowed" target="_blank">slowed</a> 1 until the end of your next turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>CLUB</strong>: You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/forced-movement" target="_blank">forced movement.</a></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>DART</strong>: The target takes 1d6+2 persistent bleed damage.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>FLAIL</strong>: The target is knocked <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/prone" target="_blank">prone</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>HAMMER</strong>: The target is knocked <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/prone" target="_blank">prone</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>KNIFE</strong>: The target takes 1d6+2 persistent bleed damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>PICK</strong>: The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes 4 additional damage.</br></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>POLEARM</strong>: The target is moved 5 feet in a direction of your choice.

The target is <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/clumsy" target="_blank">clumsy</a> 1 until the start of your next turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>SWORD</strong>: The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> until the start of your next turn.</div></div>
