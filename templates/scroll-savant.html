These scrolls follow the normal rules for <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//magic-item-rules" target="_blank">scrolls</a>, with some additional restrictions. The spells cost nothing to create, but you DO have to cast the spell when you create them. Each scroll must be of a different spell Tier, and both spell levels must be at least 1 tier lower than your highest-level spell tier. Any scrolls you create this way become non-magical the next time you make your daily preparations. A temporary scroll has no value.</div></div>
