While in critter shape, you gain the effect of a trained tier <a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//pest-form" target="_blank">pest form</a>, except you can only transform into a specific animal form, and you can speak while in this form. You can remain in critter shape for up to 10 minutes, after which you transform back into your hybrid shape or humanoid shape and can't enter your critter shape again for 1 hour. If your inherent animal is normally larger than Tiny, you transform into a smaller, younger version of the animal, such as a Tiny bear cub. If your inherent animal has a fly Speed, you can turn into that animal, but you still don't gain a fly Speed unless your base form has a fly speed.</br></div></div>
