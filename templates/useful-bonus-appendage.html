</br><h1>Useful Bonus Appendage</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>1 Point</strong></div><div><strong>Physiology; Useful Bonus Appendage</strong></div><div>You have a tail, Snake arms, tentacles, animated hair, an animated shadow or the like. You can perform simple Interact actions with it, such as opening an unlocked door. It can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items. You get +2 to deception checks to prevent people from noticing that you have the appendage to use in this fashion (for example, if you were being bound to a chair, your kidnapper may get a check to realize they should bind your hair as well.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Additionally, you gain the following reaction: <br /></br><strong>Shed Appendage;</strong> <strong>Reaction; Trigger You become</br></strong><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/grabbed" target="_blank"><strong>grabbed</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br /></br>You can shed your bonus appendage to escape. You cease being grabbed, then</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/stride" target="_blank">Stride</br></a>without triggering any reactions from the creature that grabbed you. It takes 1 week for your appendage to fully grow back. Until it does, you can't use any of your Useful Bonus Appendage feats.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+1 Point)</strong> Climbing Appendage: You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/climb" target="_blank">Climb</br></a>and you reduce the number of free hands required to Climb or Trip by one. You can also hang by your appendage from any suitable anchor point, such as a tree branch, balcony, or rocky outcropping (subject to the GM's discretion), typically while climbing. While hanging, you have free use of all your other limbs, so you can perform tasks that require both hands, such as firing a bow or swinging a greatsword.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+1 Point)</strong> Hard Appendage: You can lash out with your appendage with the strength of a whip. You gain an unarmed attack that deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage and has the</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/sweep" target="_blank">sweep</br></a>trait. Optionally, it has the finesse trait as well.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+1 Point)</strong> Larcenous Appendage: Your Appendage's chaotic and independent nature causes it to perform mischief even when you don't intend it, and it can somehow steal things it shouldn't be able to handle. You can use it to</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/steal" target="_blank">Steal</br></a>an object, though it still can't hold onto it at the end of your action. If you have a hand free, you can transfer the stolen object to your hand. Otherwise, your appendage surreptitiously drops it on the ground in your space, where you can grab it later. Observers other than your target who haven't witnessed you stealing something with it are usually distracted, meaning the GM will usually decrease their Perception DCs, as normal for Stealing something.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+1 Point) </strong>Mischievous Appendage: Your Appendage can bedevil your foes. You can</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/disarm" target="_blank">Disarm</br></a>and</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/trip" target="_blank">Trip</br></a>creatures with it, even if you don't have a free hand. All restrictions of Useful Bonus Appendage otherwise continue to apply. Your appendage has the</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/disarm-weapon-trait" target="_blank">disarm</br></a>and</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/trip-weapon-trait" target="_blank">trip</br></a>traits.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Boost (+1 Point) </strong>Appendage Spin (requires Mischievous Appendage Boost): You excel at using your tail as a weapon to upend your foes. Attempt a single Athletics check to</br><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/trip" target="_blank">Trip</a></br>up to two adjacent creatures. If you roll a success against a target, you get a critical success against that target instead.</div></div>
