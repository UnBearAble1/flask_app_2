Whenever you're affected by a bestial mutagen, you gain the mutagen's item bonus to your <a href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com//intimidation-chr" target="_blank">Intimidation</a> checks. In addition, your claws and jaws are increasingly vicious, and they gain the deadly d10 trait. Finally, you can increase the mutagen's penalty to AC from -1 to -2 and, in exchange, increase the damage die size of your claws and jaws by one step.</div></div>
