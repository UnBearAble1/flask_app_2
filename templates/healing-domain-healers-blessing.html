When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 8 additional Hit Points.<br /></br><br /></br>The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.</div></div>
