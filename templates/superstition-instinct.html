</br><h1>Superstition Instinct</h1></br><div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>5 Points</strong></div><div><strong>Warrior; Rage</strong></div><div><strong>Instinct-style; Prerequisites: </strong><a data-composite="true" href="https://unbearable1.pythonanywhere.com/rage" target="_blank"><strong>Rage</strong></a></div><div><strong>Limit: You can only have one instinct-style feat.</strong><br /></br></div><div>A deep distrust of magic drives you to forgo and counter the metaphysical nonsense of spellcasters. Whether you're a member of a superstitious family or culture that distrusts magic, a warrior in constant battle against wizards and witches, a survivor of a magical accident that instilled an intense aversion in your mind and body, or a scion of a bloodline known for its magic resistance, your rage is inimical to magic. This makes you an excellent mage hunter but slow to trust practitioners of magical arts. Your extremely restrictive anathema grants you powers beyond those of other instincts.</div><div><br /></div><div>Superstitious Resilience: While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to all saves against magic. Increase your damage from Rage from 2 to 4 against creatures that can cast spells. When you enter Rage for the first time in a pitched battle against an enemy, you regain Hit Points equal to the temporary Hit Points you gain from that Rage action. This has a tier of effect equal to your tier in Warrior. <br /></br><br /></br>Anathema: Willingly accepting the effects of magic spells (including from scrolls, wands, and the like), even from your allies, is anathema to your instinct. You can still drink potions and invest and activate most magic items you find, though items that cast spells are subject to the same restrictions as all other spells. If an ally insists on using magic on you despite your unwillingness, and you have no reason to believe they will stop, continuing to travel with that ally of your own free will counts as willingly accepting their spells (as do similar circumstances) and thus is also anathema to your instinct. </br>Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the instinct's abilities and any feats that list your instinct as a prerequisite until you spend 1 day of downtime re-centering yourself, though you keep all of your other barbarian abilities.<br /></br><br /></br>Raging Resistance: You gain your Constitution Modifier in resistance against all damage you take from spells cast.</br></div><div><br /></div><div>Special: You can only benefit from one Instinct type per rage</div></div>
