You embellish your spellcaster with entrancing flourishes and grand pronouncements, making it harder to identify or counter. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, creatures with the ability to Cast that Spell don't automatically know what the spell is. In addition, creatures that witness your spellcasting take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks to identify the spell with <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/recall-knowledge" target="_blank">Recall Knowledge</a> and checks to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/counteracting" target="_blank">counteract</a> the spell during its casting (such as with <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/counterspell" target="_blank">Counterspell</a>).</div></div>
