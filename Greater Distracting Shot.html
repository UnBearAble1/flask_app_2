Even a single missile can throw off your enemy’s balance, and more powerful attacks leave it flustered for longer. If you hit your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, it’s <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/flat-footed" target="_blank">flat-footed</a> until the start of your next turn.
