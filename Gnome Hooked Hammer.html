<strong>Group</strong> Hammer; <strong>Traits</strong>  Trip, Two-Hand 2d10, Uncommon, Versatile P</div><div><br /></div><div>This gnome tool and weapon features a hammer at one end and a curved pick on the other. It’s such a strange and awkward weapon that others think the gnomes are slightly erratic for using it.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Trip:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Two-Hand 2d10:</strong></div><div>This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Versatile P:</strong></div><div>A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.</div></div>
