After a successful check to Track, you can continue following the tracks at half your Speed without attempting additional checks for up to 1 hour. In some cases, you might Track in an encounter. In this case, Track is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration trait, but you might need to roll more often because you’re in a tense situation. The GM determines how often you must attempt this check.</div><div><br /></div><div>You attempt your <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/survival-wis" target="_blank">Survival</a> check when you start Tracking, once every hour you continue tracking, and any time something significant changes in the trail.

  <li><strong>Success</strong> You find the trail or continue to follow the one you’re already following.</li>  <li><strong>Failure</strong> You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour delay.</li>  <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You lose the trail and can’t try again for 24 hours.</li></ul></div><div data-component-type="heading"><h2 id="" level="4">Sample Track Tasks</h2></div><div data-component-type="text"><ul>
