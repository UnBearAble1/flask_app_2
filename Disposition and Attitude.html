<div data-component-type="text"><div>Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes that reflect how they view your character. These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Helpful</strong>:  A creature that is helpful to a character wishes to actively aid that character. It will accept reasonable <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/request" target="_blank">Requests</a> from that character, as long as such requests aren't at the expense of the helpful creature's goals or quality of life. If the character or one of their allies uses a hostile action against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Friendly</strong>: This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC. A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character. The character can attempt to Make a Request of a friendly creature, and the friendly creature is likely to agree to a simple and safe request that doesn't cost it much to fulfill. If the character or one of their allies uses hostile actions against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Indifferent</strong>: (Most NPCs start out indifferent.) A creature that is indifferent to a character doesn't really care one way or the other about that character. Assume a creature's attitude to a given character is indifferent unless specified otherwise.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Unfriendly</strong>: A creature that is unfriendly to a character dislikes and specifically distrusts that character. The unfriendly creature won't accept Requests from the character.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Hostile</strong>: A creature that is hostile to a character actively seeks to harm that character. It doesn't necessarily attack, but it won't accept Requests from the character.</div><div><br /></div><div>No one can ever change the attitude of a player character with these skills. You can role-play interactions with player characters, and even use <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/diplomacy-chr" target="_blank">Diplomacy</a> results if the player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or charming a character is, but players make the ultimate decisions about how their characters respond.</div></div>
