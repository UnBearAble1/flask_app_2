You can use Medicine to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a Legendary Medicine check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with 1 Hit Point, no points in any pools or any other daily resources, and still with any long-term debilitations of the old body. It is also <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/clumsy" target="_blank">clumsy </a>2, <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/drained" target="_blank">drained </a>2, and <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/enfeebled" target="_blank">enfeebled </a>2 for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. It also has the <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/wounded" target="_blank">wounded </a>condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.</div></div>
