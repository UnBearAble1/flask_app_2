You are skilled at making quick fixes to damaged equipment, but your fixes aren't meant to last forever. You make a quick <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/repair" target="_blank">repair</a> to a broken non-magical item in your possession. Until the item takes damage again, you can still use it as a <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/shoddy" target="_blank">shoddy</a> item of its type. This repair restores no Hit Points, so the item is easy to destroy. Once the item is Repaired normally such that it is no longer broken, it is also no longer shoddy.</div></div>
