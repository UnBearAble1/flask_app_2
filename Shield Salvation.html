</strong></a>You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next preparations.</div></div>
