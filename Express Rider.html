You know how to encourage your mount to cover ground quickly. When calculating your travel speed for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature check to <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/command-an-animal" target="_blank">Command an Animal</a> to increase your mount's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based on the mount's quality or the difficulty of the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your mount's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your mount's movement in encounters.</div></div>
