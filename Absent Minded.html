This doesn’t mean a single foe in combat, as the combat itself is interesting enough to keep your interest with no penalty.

Otherwise you become fascinated by your own thoughts. </li>  <li>The DM may call for you to make self-control rolls to remember key things that your absent mindedness may have caused you to forget (and at the most inconvenient times as well) - such as reloading your crossbow between encounters or getting all the items on your shopping list. You, the player, cannot override this by the fact that you are in fact not absent-minded. No amount of out-of-character preparation can prevent these rolls. </li></ul><div><br /></div></div>
