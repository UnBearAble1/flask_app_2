Using slang, jokes, loanwords, and the like, you convey a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as “Danger assassin flee” or “Meet me moonrise”). Your intended listener can attempt a Perception check to discern the message (Trained Hard DC if an ally, Trained Moderate DC if a same-ancestry ally, Trained Easy if a same-ancestry ally with Folksy Patter). Eavesdroppers can also attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC to discern your meaning. Any bonuses or penalties to Perception checks to Sense Motive apply.</div><div><br /></div><div>Additionally, you can attempt to recover critical failures with deception using this folksy patter. If you critically fail, you can re-roll at -2. Any creatures who hear this attempt are immune to it for one month afterward. </div></div>
