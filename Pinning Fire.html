You target your opponent's clothing, equipment, or loose flesh with piercing projectiles to pin them to the ground or a nearby surface. If both your attacks hit, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or become <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/immobilized" target="_blank">immobilized</a> until it or an adjacent creature succeeds at a DC 10 Athletics check to remove the pinning projectiles. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.</div></div>
