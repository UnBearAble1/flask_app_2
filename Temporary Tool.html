The temporary tool spell can be used to create only simple tools, and therefore cannot create kits, which are complex objects made of multiple pieces, or objects made of any specific precious material. It lasts until it is used for a single activity or for 1 minute, whichever comes first, after which it disappears. The tool is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus can’t be sold or passed off as a genuine item.</div></div>
