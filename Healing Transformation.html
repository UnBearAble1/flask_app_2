You can take advantage of shapechanging magic to close wounds and patch injuries. If your next action is to cast a non-cantrip polymorph spell that targets only one creature, your polymorph spell also restores 1d6 Hit Points per tier to that creature. This is a healing effect, and has an effective tier equal to one tier lower than the spell. </div></div>
