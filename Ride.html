When you <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/command-an-animal" target="_blank">Command an Animal</a> you’re mounted on to take a move action (such as <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stride" target="_blank">Stride</a>), you automatically succeed instead of needing to attempt a check. Any animal you’re mounted on acts on your turn, like a minion. If you <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/mount" target="_blank">Mount</a> an animal in the middle of an encounter, it skips its next turn and then acts on your next turn.</div></div>
