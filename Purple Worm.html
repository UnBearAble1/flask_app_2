Tunnels bored by a purple worm don’t always last long after these creature’s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening mazes of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to find the worm’s central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm’s prior victims.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Animal (Nature)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Gargantuan, Animal, Brute </strong></div><div>Perception +10; darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 100 feet</div><div>Skills Athletics +17</div><div>Str +9, Dex -1, Con +7, Int -5, Wis -1, Cha -1</div><div><strong>AC 21; Fort +13 , Ref +9 , Will +11</strong></div><div><strong>HP: 170 </strong></div><div><strong>Speed 40 feet, burrow 40 feet, swim 20 feet</strong></div><ul>
