You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/climb" target="_blank">Climb </a>and you reduce the number of free hands required to Climb or Trip by one. You can also hang by your appendage from any suitable anchor point, such as a tree branch, balcony, or rocky outcropping (subject to the GM's discretion), typically while climbing. While hanging, you have free use of all your other limbs, so you can perform tasks that require both hands, such as firing a bow or swinging a greatsword.</div></div>
