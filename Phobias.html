This is an irrational fear, out of your control and not inhibited by reason or logical deduction. </div><div><br /></div><div>When you encounter the subject of your fear, make a Self-Control check. If you fail, you are <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/frightened" target="_blank">frightened</a> 1 (or frightened 2 on a critical failure - and you must immediately make a willpower save with master DC or become <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/fleeing" target="_blank">fleeing</a> until you are out of the area) until you are out of the presence of the subject. If you succeed, you've mastered your fear for now. Even the mere threat of your fear forces your roll, but at -4 if you can't see the subject. </div><div><br /></div><div>The point value of this complication is based on how common your fear is. Here are some common phobias: </div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Being Alone (Autophobia): [-3 pts]</strong> You cannot stand to be alone, and do anything in your power to avoid it. </li>  <li><strong>Blood (Hemophobia): [-2 pts]</strong> The sight of blood gives you the screaming willies! You need to make a self-control roll during most combats . . . -10 points.*</li>  <li><strong>Cats (Ailurophobia): [-1 pt]</strong></li>  <li><strong>Crowds (Demophobia): [-3 pts] </strong>Any group of over a dozen people sets off this fear unless they are all well known to you. The self-control roll is at -1 for over 25 people, -2 for a crowd of 100 or more, -3 for 1,000, -4 for 10,000, and so on.</li>  <li><strong>Darkness (Scotophobia):[-3 pts] </strong> A common fear, but crippling. You should avoid being underground if possible; if something happens to your lantern or torch, you might well lose your mind before you can relight it. </li>  <li><strong>Death and the Dead (Necrophobia) [-3 pts]: </strong>You are terrified by the idea of death. Make a self-control roll in the presence of any dead body (animals don’t count, but portions of human bodies do). Roll at -4 if the body is that of someone you know, or -6 if the body is unnaturally animated in some way. A ghost (or apparent ghost) also requires a roll at -6. </li>  <li><strong>Dirt (Mysophobia) [-2 pts]:</strong> You are deathly afraid of infection, or just of dirt and filth. Make a self-control roll when you must do something that might get you dirty. Roll at -5 to eat any unaccustomed food. You should act as “finicky” as possible. </li>  <li><strong>Dogs (Cynophobia): [-1 pt] </strong>This includes all canines: foxes, wolves, coyotes, wild dogs, etc. </li>  <li><strong>Enclosed Spaces (Claustrophobia) [-5 pts]:</strong> A common, crippling fear. You are uncomfortable any time you can’t see the sky – or at least a very high ceiling. In a small room or vehicle, you feel the walls closing in on you . . . You need air! This is a dangerous fear for someone who plans to go underground. </li>  <li><strong>Fire (Pyrophobia): [-2 pts] </strong>Even a burning cigarette bothers you if it comes within five yards.</li>  <li><strong>Heights (Acrophobia): [-2 pts]</strong> You may not voluntarily go more than 15 feet above ground, unless you are inside a building and away from windows. If there is some chance of an actual fall, self-control rolls are at -5. </li>  <li><strong>Insects (Entomophobia): [-2 pts]</strong> You are afraid of all “bugs.” Large or poisonous ones give -3 to self-control rolls. Very large ones, or large numbers, give -6. Avoid hills of giant ants.</li>  <li><strong>Loud Noises (Brontophobia): [-2 pts]</strong> You avoid any situation where loud noises are likely. A sudden loud noise requires an immediate self-control roll. A thunderstorm is a traumatic experience for you! </li>  <li><strong>Magic (Manaphobia): [-3 pts]</strong> You can never learn to use magic, and you react badly to any user of magic. Make a self-control roll whenever you are in the presence of magic. This roll is at -3 if you are to be the target of friendly magic, and -6 if you are the target of hostile magic. (The magic does not have to be real, if you believe in it!) </li>  <li><strong>Monsters (Teratophobia): [-3 pts</strong>] Any “unnatural” creature sets off this fear. You have -1 to -4 on the self-control roll if the monster seems very large or dangerous, or if there are a lot of them. Note that the definition of “monster” depends on experience.</li>  <li><strong>Oceans (Thalassophobia):[-2 pts]</strong> You are afraid of any large body of water. Ocean travel, or even air travel over the ocean, is basically impossible for you, and encounters with aquatic monsters are also upsetting. </li>  <li><strong>Open Spaces (Agoraphobia): [-2 pts] </strong>You are uncomfortable whenever you are outside, and actually become frightened when there are no walls within 50 feet. </li>  <li><strong>Reptiles (Herpetophobia): [-2 pts] </strong> You come unglued at the thought of rep- tiles, amphibians, and similar scaly slimies. A very large reptile, or a poisonous one, gives -2 to self-control rolls; a horde of reptiles (such as a snake pit) gives -4. </li>  <li><strong>Sex (Coitophobia) [-2 pts]:</strong> You are terrified by the idea of sexual relations or the loss of your virginity. </li>  <li><strong>Sharp Things (Aichmophobia): [-3 pts] </strong>You are afraid of anything pointed. Swords, spears, knives, and hypoder- mic needles all give you fits. Trying to use a sharp weapon, or being threat- ened with one, requires a self-control roll at -2. </li>  <li><strong>Spiders (Arachnophobia): [-1 pt]</strong></li>  <li><strong>Strange and Unknown Things (Xenophobia): [-5 pts] </strong>You are upset by any sort of strange circumstances, and in particular by strange people. Make a self-control roll when surrounded by people of another race or nationality; roll at -3 if the people are not your species. If you lose control, you might well attack strangers out of fear. </li>  <li><strong>Sun (Heliophobia): [-3 pts]</strong></li>  <li><strong>Weapons (Hoplophobia): [-4 pts]  </strong>The presence of any sort of weaponry is stressful. Trying to use a weapon, or being threatened with one, requires a self- control roll at -2.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
