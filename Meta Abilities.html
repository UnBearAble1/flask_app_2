<br />
</strong>You set a contingency. This is a special type of trigger that automatically activates another  Effect when certain conditions are met. Each time you activate this effect, you set the trigger condition and the effect that is triggered.<br />
<br />
Additional Rules: </div><ul>
  <li>The Effect must match the source of your Contingency (mechanical, magical, or psionic) </li>  <li>The special ability cannot be one that takes more than two actions to activate.  </li>  <li>Because this is dynamically chosen each time, it doesn’t qualify as a Situational Limit (unless your ability to use the Contingency power itself has a situational limit.) </li>  <li>Any individual person can only have up to three contingencies set upon their person at a time. </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>The cost is based on the type of activation of the contingent ability and how long it remains in effect, and how many contingencies you can have active at one time. </div><div><br /></div><div>Contingency Duration: </div><ul>
  <li>Your Contingency lasts 24 hours (Base: 8) </li>  <li>Your Contingency lasts 1 week (Base: 12) </li>  <li>Your Contingency lasts indefinitely (Base: 16) </li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Activation Type: </div><ul>

<strong>Activation: Duration </strong></div><div><strong>Default Duration: 2 / 1d4 rounds </strong></div><div><strong>Default Range: 30 feet (maximum: 120 feet) </strong><br />
</div><div>When you activate this effect, you designate an alternate point of origin for your effects that applies until the duration expires.  Like all abilities, you must have line of effect and sight to the new point of origin, but from then the point of origin is considered “you” for line of effect. <br />
<br />
The maximum range you can be from your point of origin at any time you activate an effect to apply to it is the range of this ability.<br />
</div><div>Origin must be: </div><ul>
  <li>An ally (Base: 8) </li>  <li>An enemy (Base: 8, Mod +4) </li>  <li>Any square (Base: 12, Mod +8) </li>  <li>A specific item, specified at creation (Base: 8, Mod +6) </li>  <li>Another effect (made from creation, illusion, alteration, etc, specified at creation) (Base: 8, Mod +2)<br />

Activation: Instantaneous </strong><br />

Note: This ability will not let you double up the amount of damage you deal in a round or targets for a damaging effect, even if you reposition a damaging effect in a way that it would make sense. You could move a zone that damages creatures non-immediately, however.<br />

<strong>Activation: Instantaneous</strong><br />
</div><div>This complex effect is an augmentation to other effects. Once activated, this ability modifies the very next action you take. <br />
</div><div>Degree of Augmentation: </div><ul>
  <li>Added Specific Boost: Pay for the boost as normal, then add Base +8 for this boost.  </li>  <li>Reduced Specific Limit: Pay off the boost as normal, then add Base +8 for this boost. </li>  <li>Alter existing Choices: This alters a single choice (chosen when you design this ability) made when the modified ability was originally selected, such as changing the type of damage on a damaging effect to a specified new type. (Base: 8, Mod +2). </li>  <li>Added Effects:  You add entirely new effects to the activated effect. To calculate the base cost of this &quot;augmentation&quot;, build the group of effects you want to add as normal, then add Mod +6 to each of them from the boost of this effect (you cannot select a situational limit reflecting that they can only be used in this added way, that is already calculated in this boost's cost). Add the number of actions this ability cost to the actions to activate the “Temporary Ability Augmentations” effect itself (2 reactions aren’t possible, so in that case it uses an action and a reaction).<br />
