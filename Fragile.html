This doesn't mean that you take more damage than normal, just that when you DO take extreme amounts of damage something happens to you beyond what a normal mammal would experience. This complication is usually best used as an Ancestry one, but there could be cases for having it be a background feature. The point value is based on what specific fragility you have: </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Brittle [-3 pts]:</strong> You are typically crystalline (ice or salt based, for example) or rotten (like an animated corpse. When any of your limbs take crippling damage, instead of just becoming crippled, they actually break off entirely. Further, if you critically fail a <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/kb/en/article/death-dying-and-recovery" target="_blank">recovery check</a> you, or when you die (for any reason), you instantly shatter, melt into goo, or otherwise completely destroyed. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Combustable [-1 pt]</strong>: Your body is made of flammable material (maybe wood, maybe incredibly dry flesh, or similar material.) Whenever you suffer a critical hit from fire damage (or critically fail a defense roll) you take an additional 1d6 persistent fire damage. Further, your flat checks to get rid of persistent fire damage are 2 higher than normal (usually DC 17, or DC 12 if assisted.) You cannot have fire resistance or other abilities that limit fire damage or make persistent fire damage easier to put out. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Flammable [-2 pts]:</strong> As Combustable, but any critical hit (not just from fire damage) will set you ablaze. Further, if it was fire damage, you take an additional 2d6 persistent fire damage (instead of the additional 1d6). </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Explosive [-3 pts]</strong>: Your body is explosive, probably because it is filled with explosive gas. If you critically fail a recovery check, or are instantly killed by any effect that doesn't utterly destroy your body (such as with the disintegrate spell) you instantly explode. Not only are you completely destroyed, but the explosion deals 10d6 force damage to a 20 foot radius around your body (Reflex save). </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Unnatural [-10 pts]:</strong> Your body is completely unnatural, possibly because you are a construct or are barely held in our reality by summoning magic. If you are ever reduced to 0 hit points, you are immediately destroyed. (This is one of the few complications that can be taken as both your 5 possible points of ancestry complications, and 5 of your background complication points.)</div><div><br /></div><div><em>Note: It's very possible to have more than one of the above. Such as being both flammable and brittle. </em></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
