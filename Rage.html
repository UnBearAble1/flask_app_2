You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your 5 plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:</div><ul>
  <li>You deal 2 additional damage with melee Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/agile" target="_blank">agile</a>.</li>  <li>You take a –1 penalty to AC.</li>  <li>You can't use actions with the <em>concentrate</em> trait unless they also have the <em>rage</em> trait. You can <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/seek" target="_blank">Seek</a> while raging.</li>  <li>After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.<br />
</li></ul><div>Optional Rule: You can add the &quot;Rage&quot; trait to any Warrior feat (that makes sense, work with the GM.) Doing so means you can only use the feat while raging, but reduces it's cost by 20% (round up)</div></div>
