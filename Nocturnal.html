You cannot function when the sun is above the horizon, at all. You start to grow lethargic when the sun starts to come up, and by the time it clears the horizon fully you fall into a paralytic coma until the sun sets again. </div><div><br /></div><div><em>Permanent Paralysis: [-8]</em> If you instead become permanently paralyzed, such as permanently turned to stone, if struck by daylight (like a traditional Troll) this complication is worth -8 total points. This paralysis can only be cured by some high level ritual or item that would likely require a quest to resolve. </div></div>
