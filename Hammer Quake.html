You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby creatures to the ground. Choose a square within your reach, including your own space. If there's a foe in the chosen square, <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/strike" target="_blank">Strike</a> that foe with the required weapon. Then attempt to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/trip" target="_blank">Trip</a> every foe in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip's requirement that you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made the Strike, if any, and all the Trip attempts.</div></div>
