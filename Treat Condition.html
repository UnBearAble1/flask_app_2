You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/clumsy" target="_blank">clumsy</a>, <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/enfeebled" target="_blank">enfeebled</a>, or <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/sickened" target="_blank">sickened </a>condition. If the duration is longer than a minute, you may only attempt this check once. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/counteracting" target="_blank">counteract </a>check against the condition, using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or deity unless you have <a href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/legendary-medic" target="_blank">Legendary Medic</a>; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a good character gains from carrying an unholy weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.</div><ul>
