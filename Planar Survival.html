You can <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/subsist" target="_blank">Subsist</a> using Survival on different planes, even those without resources or natural phenomena you normally need. For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks food that could normally sustain you.
