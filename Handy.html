<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>1 Point</strong></div><div><strong>Cultural Training; Crafting</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Your people are particularly crafty. You gain the following benefits: </div><ul>
  <li> A +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/repair" target="_blank">Repair</a> non-magical items.</li>  <li>You can <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/repair" target="_blank">Repair</a> an item without using a repair kit without taking the –2 circumstance penalty, improvising tools from whatever you have at hand, and don't need a flat surface. </li>  <li>You can repair two items each time you use the Repair action. </li>  <li>You can use your knowledge of engineering and metalwork to temporarily strengthen thick objects and structures. By spending 1 hour working on a medium sized or larger item, you can give it a +1 circumstance bonus to its Hardness. If you're a master in Crafting, the bonus is +2, and if you're legendary, the bonus is +3. You can reinforce a portion of a structure, though 1 hour usually reinforces only a door, a few windows, or another section that fits within a 10-foot cube. A single structure can only be enhanced this way once. </li>  <li>You can make useful tools out of even twisted or rusted scraps. When using the Crafting skill to <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/craft" target="_blank">Craft</a>, you can make basic trained tier, common items, including weapons but not armor, out of junk. This reduces the Price to one-quarter the usual amount but always results in a shoddy item. Shoddy items normally give a penalty, but you don't take this penalty when using shoddy items you made. You can also incorporate junk to save money while you Craft any item. This grants you a discount on the item as if you had spent 1 additional day working to reduce the cost, but the item is obviously made of junk. At the GM's discretion, this might affect the item's resale value depending on the buyer's tastes.</li></ul></div>
