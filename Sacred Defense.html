You call upon your deity to grant you their protective blessing. Attempt a DC 7 Religion check. Unlike with other skill checks, having a higher proficiency doesn't guarantee a minimum roll on this check.  If you have legendary proficiency in Religion, you can instead attempt a DC 12 Religion check for added benefit (see blow) increase the temporary Hit Points you gain on a successful check to 15 (25 on a critical success).</div><ul>
  <li>Critical Success You gain 10 temporary Hit Points, or 25 if you rolled vs DC 12. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.</li>  <li>Success You gain 5 temporary Hit Points, or 10 if you rolled vs DC 12. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.</li>  <li>Critical Failure Your deity withholds their blessing. You cannot attempt to call to your deity again for 1 day.</li></ul></div>
