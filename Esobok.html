<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 4</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the guard dogs of the Boneyard. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of dark feathers around their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks rarely bother with those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to go about their business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when sniffing out threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they're among the least intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling threats. The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won't do so twice.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Monitor (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>N, Medium, Monitor, Psychopomp, Skirmisher</strong></div><div>Perception +8; darkvision, lifesense 60 feet, scent (imprecise) 60 feet</div><div>Languages Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, Requian</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +7, Athletics +7, Intimidation +6, Religion +1, Stealth +5, Survival +7</div><div>Str +3, Dex +3, Con +4, Int -3, Wis +3, Cha +2</div><div><strong>AC 18 ; Fort +7 , Ref +9 , Will +5</strong></div><div><strong>HP 40; Immunities death effects, disease; Resistances negative 5, poison 5</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 30 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>: </div><div>Spirit Touch: An esobok's Strikes affect incorporeal creatures with the effects of a <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/ghost-touch" target="_blank">ghost touch </a>property and deal 1d6 negative damage to living creatures and 1d6 positive damage to undead.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Actions</strong>: </div><ul>

The creature must attempt a DC 18 Will save. Creatures without souls (such as most constructs) and creatures whose bodies and souls are one (such as most celestials, fiends, and monitors) that roll a failure or critical failure on the save get a success instead.
    <ul>
      <li>Critical Success The creature is unaffected.</li>      <li>Success The target is <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stunned" target="_blank">stunned</a> 1.</li>      <li>Failure The esobok wrenches the target's soul from its body into its jaws.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature paralyzed by this effect can attempt a new save to end the effect. The paralysis ends automatically if the esobok attempts a jaws Strike or speaks.</li>      <li>Critical Failure As failure, but as long as a creature is stunned or paralyzed, it is also <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stupefied" target="_blank">stupefied</a> 2.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul></div>
