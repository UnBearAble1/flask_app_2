You use the power of your Rain-Scribe magic to draw on a stream of primal power for sustenance. You don’t need to eat or drink and need only 6 hours of rest to feel well rested. If you have any abilities that mention daily preparations, you must still spend 1 hour to prepare them. You can draw on primal power to stay awake and alert while otherwise resting your body and mind, gaining the full benefits of an 8-hour rest without falling asleep. When you do, you lose the other benefits of Rain- Scribe Sustenance for 1 week while your primal energies recharge.</div></div>
