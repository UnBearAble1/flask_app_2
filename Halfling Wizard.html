<strong>Spellcasting</strong>: (<a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/magic-and-spellcasting" target="_blank">Full Rules</a>) </div><ul>
  <li>Access to all spheres except for Fauna and Spirit.  </li>  <li>On Strain: For each five points of strain you have, you take -1 Strain penalty to all perception, defense, and skill checks and -5 feet of movement. If your penalty gets up to -4, you fall unconscious. </li>  <li>Spell Effect DC and Strain: 
    <ul>
      <li>F, DC 3, 1 Strain (on a fail only) </li>      <li>D, DC 5, 1 Strain </li>      <li>C, DC 7, 2 Strain </li>      <li>B, DC 10, 4 Strain </li>      <li>A, DC 15, 6 Strain </li>      <li>S, DC 19, 8 Strain </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Bonded Item: Wand. The prepared caster can cast Magic into the item as part of designating the item as a bonded item. They make the Cast Magic roll, and suffer any strain as part of the preparation. Later, they can spend the appropriate number of actions to Cast the stored Magic without needing to make a roll or suffer the resulting strain. Once they do this, the item no longer has any stored magic. They must have the item held in a hand to use it.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><strong>Abilities: </strong></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Halfling Courage</strong>: Treat your defense checks against the Frightened Condition as one category better. </li>  <li><strong>Halfling Stealth: </strong>By taking 10 minutes to prepare yourself, you can use the Avoid Notice exploration activity for an hour and re-roll any checks you make for it during that time with a reaction. You must keep the new roll, even if it is worse.  In encounter mode, you can use 2 actions to activate the ability to re-roll with a reaction any Hide or Stealth rolls you make for the next  minute. </li>  <li><strong>Halfling Luck</strong>:  Once per day, when you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to be reduced to 1 hit point instead (you still gain a wound). Doing so gives your armor the broken condition. </li>  <li><strong>Avert Spellcasting Disaster</strong>: If you critically fail a spellcasting roll, you can use a reaction to turn it into a normal failure instead. Once you've done so, you can't do so again until perform a ritual to recenter yourself. The ritual requires 3 days of downtime, and 250 gold of ingredients. Additionally, each day after you've used this ability, once during your daily preparations, you must attempt a DC 9 Arcana check. Until you've made this check, even if you have performed the re-centering activity listed above, you cannot use this ability again. </li>  <li><strong>Craft Magic Items:</strong> You can craft Magic Items using the normal Downtime Crafting and Adventure Crafting rules. You can't use actions with the concentrate trait while doing so. </li>  <li><strong>Perfect Phonetics</strong>: You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with this ability or that speaks the language to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Tier F Spells: </strong></div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Shield</strong> [Force] (Tier F):  One Action (combat) or 5 minutes (out of combat). Duration: 30 minutes.

      <li>You gain 10 temporary hit points, but they only apply against attacks within 5 feet and that deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.<br />
<br />

    <ul>
      <li>1 Action: 2d6+10 cold damage, or 4d6+10 damage on a critical hit. </li>      <li>2 Actions: 6d6+10 cold damage, or 8d6+10 damage on a critical hit.<br />

</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br />
<strong>Tier D Spells</strong>: </div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Detect Magic </strong>(Tier D): Free Action (combat) or 1 minute (out of combat) to cast.  
    <ul>
      <li>You gain the imprecise sense: Magic Sense with a range of 30 feet. You can detect magic in the area, and the tradition and sphere of magic for the highest-tier effect within range that you detect.  If multiple effects are equally strong, the GM determines which you learn. As an imprecise sense, you can narrow the magic down to a five foot area.<br />
<br />
</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Feather Fall </strong>(Tier D): (Reaction) Trigger: You or a creature within 60 feet begins to fall. 
    <ul>
      <li>You reduce the creature's fall speed to 60 feet per round (20 feet per action), and they take no damage from this fall. <br />
<br />
</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><strong>Tier C Spells:</strong><br />
</div><ul>
  <li><strong>Mirror Image</strong> [Illusion, Visual] (Tier C): One Action (combat). Duration: 10 minutes. 
    <ul>
      <li>You create a double of yourself that mirrors your movements. When targeted by a Guard or Reflex single target attack, roll a dice to see if the image is targeted or if you are. Once an image is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit you  but doesn't critically fail, it destroys an image but has no additional effect (even if the attack would normally have an effect on a failure). If an attack roll is a critical success and hits one of the images, one of the images is destroyed and the attack roll becomes a success against you. 
        <ul>
          <li>1 Image: The chances of hitting you are 1 in 2; (1-3 on a 1d6 hits you) </li>          <li>2 Images: The chances of hitting you are 1 in 3; (1-2 on a 1d6 hits you)<br />

    <ul>
      <li>1 Action: You fire a bolt of force at a target within 30 feet. It does 2d6 force damage, with no attack roll needed. (Using magic missile this way is a Tier D effect) </li>      <li>2 Actions: You fire multiple bolts of force at a target within 30 feet. It does 3d6 force damage, with no attack roll needed. </li>      <li>2 Actions: You a bolt of force at a target within 120 feet. It does 2d6 force damage, with no attack roll needed. </li>      <li>3 Actions: You fire multiple bolts of force at up to two targets within 500 feet. They do 4d6 force damage, with no attack roll needed. </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Success: 4d6+10 fire damage</li>      <li>Critical Success: 8d6+10 fire damage</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Wall of Stone </strong>(Tier C): [Earth] (In combat: 3 actions, exploration: 30 minutes ) 
    <ul>
      <li>You create a stone wall, up to 100 feet long, 20 feet tall, and 1 feet thick that lasts for 8 hours. The Wall solidly fuses and affixes to surfaces as needed. You can only have one wall of stone in existence at a time. <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/creation-9164590" target="_blank">Full Creation rules here.</a></li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Teleport</strong> (Tier C): (In Combat: 2 Actions, Exploration: 10 minutes) Material Component Cost: Any heavy (1L) precious gem worth at least 25 gold. This spell may only be cast once per week. 
    <ul>
      <li>You teleport up to 20 miles away. Any location you have been to counts as both line of sight and line of effect. When you arrive, you are dazzled for 2 rounds (combat) or 4 hours (out of combat). </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Counterspell</strong> (Tier C): (Reaction) Range: 120 feet. Trigger: A creature casts an arcane spell. 
    <ul>
      <li>Make Counteract check versus the triggering creature's save DC for the spell. 
        <ul>
          <li>Success: the spell is suppressed for 1 minute, if this is longer than its remaining duration, it is dispelled. </li>          <li>Critical Success:  The spell is dispelled regardless of the duration. If the creature has the ability to cast the spell again, you can attempt to automatically counteract the effect. This lingering counteracting lasts for 1 minute.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Spider Climb</strong> (Tier C): (In Combat: 2 Actions, Exploration: 10 minutes) Duration: 1 minute in combat, 1 hour out of combat. Target: You or one other creature you touch.
    <ul>
      <li>You have a climb speed equal to your land speed</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Tier B Spells:</strong> </div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li><strong>Chain Lightning</strong> [Electricity, Attack] (Tier B): (3 Actions) You blast lightning which bounces between targets. Range: 500 feet. Can target up to 6 enemies, no two of which may be more than 60 feet apart. Roll vs Reflex against each enemy. If you critically fail on any roll, the effect ends before bouncing to new targets. 
    <ul>
      <li>4d12+10 electricity damage, or 6d12+10 on a critical hit. <br />
<br />
</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Illusory Object:</strong> [Mental, Visual and/or Auditory] (Tier B): (In Combat: 2 Actions, Exploration: 10 minutes) Duration: 1 minute in combat, 1 hour out of combat. 
    <ul>
      <li>You can create a single illusory object (not a person or scenery): the semblance of something real, fooling the eyes, ears, and other senses. Depending on how the illusion is perceived, it might have the auditory or visual traits, and also have the mental trait. </li>      <li>Your illusion can affect any senses. </li>      <li>Your illusions can have moderate specificity, and can have slightly interactive animations. Examples:  A tree that bends and bows naturally with the wind, or if touched. A portion of wall that matches the color and texture of the surrounding wall. A nonspecific voice saying something.</li>      <li>If visual, your illusion fits in a 5 foot burst</li>      <li>If sound, smell, or taste, it can replicate the volume of sound / smell / taste normally available from a group of 5 people or items</li>      <li>Illusions allow an affected creature a chance to disbelieve the effect, which lets the creature effectively ignore the effect if it succeeds at doing so. This usually happens when a creature Seeks or otherwise spends actions to engage with the illusion, which then requires you to make a check against their Perception  (or another check or defense, at the GM’s discretion). </li>      <li>If the illusion is visual, and a creature interacts with the illusion in a way that would prove it is not what it seems, the creature might know that an illusion is present, but it still can’t ignore the illusion without successfully disbelieving it. For instance, if a character is pushed through the illusion of a door, they will know that the door is an illusion, but they still can’t see through it. Disbelieving an illusion makes it and those things it blocks seem hazy and indistinct, so even in the case where a visual illusion is disbelieved, it may, at the GM’s discretion, block vision enough to make those on the other side concealed.<br />

Special Attack: Suppress effects: Tier C: (50 Points) Specific Traditions of Magic, Arcane</div><div>- This attack actually suppresses ongoing effects, possibly dispelling them altogether. Target an effect.

Doing so will randomly dispel an effect on the creature eligible for your suppression.</div><div><br /></div><div>Instead of any kind of attack roll, you are making a counteract check versus a difficulty based on the power of the effect and what created it. </div><div> </div><div>If you succeed on your counteract check the effect is suppressed for 1 minute, if this is longer than its remaining duration, it is dispelled. If you critically succeed on the check, it is dispelled regardless of the duration.
