While wearing smoked goggles, you're always considered to be <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/avert-gaze" target="_blank">Averting your Gaze,</a> but all creatures have <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/concealed" target="_blank">concealment</a> from you.
