<strong>Reaction; Usable At Will; Trigger: A foe hits you with a melee attack</strong><br />
When you take a big hit, your foe bounces you around like a rubber ball, but you escape the worst of the blow. Your foe can move you any distance of its choice up to 30 feet in a direction of its choice (this is not forced movement, and it triggers reactions as normal). You fall <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/prone" target="_blank">prone </a>and are <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/stunned" target="_blank">stunned </a>1. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. On a success, you take minimum damage from the attack, and if you rolled a 16 or higher on the flat check, you also don’t take double damage if it was a the critical hit.</li></ul></div>
