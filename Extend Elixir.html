<strong>Boost: (+7 Points) Eternal Elixir </strong>(requires: Legendary in Alchemist). Your body readily accepts and retains minor changes. When you drink one of your <em>trained-tier</em> alchemical items made with Quick or Advanced Alchemy with a duration of 1 minute or more, you can make the elixir’s duration indefinite. If you later consume a different elixir and make it indefinite, the effect of the previous indefinite elixir ends.</div></div>
