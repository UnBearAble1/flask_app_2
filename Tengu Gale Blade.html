<strong>Group</strong> Sword; <strong>Traits</strong> Agile, Disarm, Finesse, Uncommon</div><div><br /></div><div>This fan-shaped sword, designed by members of the tengu ancestry, has five broad blades that join at its hilt. Tengu sailors also use gale blades as makeshift weather vanes, as the sword spins to show the wind's direction when loosely held aloft.</div><h2>Traits</h2><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Disarm:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. </div></div>
