You batter your foes with some form of energy, shadow or force. If the next action you take is an Athletics check to Disarm, Shove, or Trip, that action has a range of 15 feet. You don't receive any item bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body, but if you roll a critical failure on that Athletics check, you get a failure instead.</div></div>
