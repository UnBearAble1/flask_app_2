1 Action; [Concentrate, Metamagic]; Prerequisites: Expert in Spellcaster</strong><br />
You can pull forth both positive and negative energy simultaneously to harm your enemies and heal your allies. If your next action is to cast a 1-action or 2-action heal or harm spell, choose one creature in range that would be harmed by the spell, and choose another creature within range that would be healed by the spell. Your heal or harm targets both creatures.</div><div><br /></div><div>For example, if you cast a 2-action Harm spell and there was both an undead and a living creature within 30 feet, you could either heal both of them or harm both of them.  If there were instead only 2 undead within 30 feet, this feat would not work. </div></div>
