You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist increases to 2d6 instead of 2d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks. You take no damage for striking hard surfaces with your fists.</div></div>
