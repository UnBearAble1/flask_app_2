You transform a non-magical arrow or bolt into a Viper Eldritch Arrow. You must shoot the ammunition before the end of your turn or the magic dissipates. <br />
<br />
After a viper arrow hits a target, the arrow transforms into a viper. The target is affected by the viper's poison, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in an open space adjacent to the target. The viper has the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/summoned" target="_blank">summoned</a> trait and acts at the end of your turn, even though you didn't use the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/sustain-a-spell" target="_blank">Sustain a Spell</a> action. It is under the GM's control, but it generally attacks the creature the arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when slain. Only one of your Viper Arrows can exist at a time.</div></div>
