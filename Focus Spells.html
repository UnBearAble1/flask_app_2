<div data-component-type="text"><div>Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from a branch of study, from a deity, or from another specific source. You can learn focus spells only through special class feats, rather than choosing them from a spell list. Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool of Focus Points—you can’t prepare a focus spell. Focus spells and regular spells from the Spellcaster class skill are not in any way interchangeable.</div><div><br /></div><div>The spell-power of a focus spell is based on the skill the class feat is tied to, or otherwise listed in the description of the spell itself. For example, the focus spell &quot;Agile Feat&quot; is obtained by selecting the &quot;<a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/travel-domain-agile-feet" target="_blank">Travel Domain: Agile Feat</a>&quot; acrobatics class feat. When you use it, you set it's DC or attack rolls (if it had any) or other modifiers based on its skill level to whatever your acrobatics skill is.</div><div><br /></div><div>Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 or more Focus Point. You automatically gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point the first time you gain an ability that gives you a focus spell.</div><div><br /></div><div>You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during your daily preparations. You can also use the Refocus activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise reattune yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain a Focus Point.</div><div><br /></div><div>Some abilities allow you to increase the Focus Points in your pool beyond 1. Typically, these are feats that give you a new focus spell and increase the number of points in your pool by 1. Your focus pool can’t have a capacity beyond 3 Focus Points, even if feats that increase your pool would cause it to exceed this number.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, when you cast a focus spell that costs only 1 focus point, you can opt to &quot;Burn&quot; the spell instead of spending a focus point to cast it. Burning a focus point spell lets you cast it as normal, for a 0 focus point cost, though prevents you from accessing it again until your next daily preparations. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Refocus </strong></div><div><strong>Concentrate, Exploration</strong></div><div><strong>Requirements: You have a focus pool, and you have spent at least 1 Focus Point since you last regained any Focus Points.</strong></div><div>You spend 10 minutes performing deeds to restore your magical connection. This restores 1 Focus Point to your focus pool. The deeds you perform are based on the theme of your feat. If the feat uses Warrior, then perhaps you perform a complex set of weapon kata to refocus. If it's religion, then maybe simple prayer and atonement will do. Work with your GM. </div><div><br /></div><div>The key thing to remember about the refocus action is that it only restores 1 focus point each time you do it, and you cannot do it unless you've spent at least 1 focus point since the last time you've refocused. This is important to remember because if you have spent more than 1 focus point (maybe by casting a Focus spell that actually costs 2 or 3 focus points to cast) you won't be able to restore back to your full focus point allotment until your next Daily Preparations. </div><div><br /></div><div>This How It's Played video is a great resource for understanding the Refocus action better, though bear in mind that this version of the PF2E game has different <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/death-dying-and-recovery" target="_blank">healing rules </a>than what are mentioned in his video: </div><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="video"><div style="text-align:center"><span class="video-overlay" style="width:650px; height:375px">
