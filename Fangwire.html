The wielder wraps the wire around a vulnerable spot, such as the neck, and twists it to inflict potentially fatal lacerations. The name derives from the use of a similar wire in traps, or slow fangs, with the word “slow” removed, as a fangwire gets quick results.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Agile:</strong></div><div>The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Backstabber:</strong></div><div>When you hit a flat-footed creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Deadly d8:</strong></div><div>On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon's damage. <br />
</div><div><strong>Finesse:</strong></div><div>You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.<br />
</div><div><strong>Grapple:</strong></div><div>You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Uncommon:</strong></div><div>Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone.</div></div>
