<div data-component-type="text"><div><strong>Threat: 6</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Despite their flaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual benefit rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to fight against fiendish powers—especially fiends that embody the sin of wrath—legion archons don’t hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recall Knowledge - Celestial (Religion)</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>LG, Medium, Archon, Celestial, Soldier </strong></div><div>Perception +9; darkvision</div><div>Languages Celestial, Draconic, Infernal; tongues</div><div>Skills Acrobatics +6, Athletics +11, Diplomacy +11, Intimidation +9, Religion +6, Survival +7</div><div>Str +5, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +1, Wis +2, Cha +5</div><div><strong>AC 21 ; Fort +11 , Ref +9 , Will +7; +1 status to all saves vs. magic</strong></div><div><strong>HP 72; Resistances fire 15; Weaknesses evil 10</strong></div><div><strong>Speed 30 feet, fly 60 feet</strong></div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Features</strong>: </div><div>Menacing Guardian (aura, divine, enchantment) 30 feet.

If the archon’s dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the same distance and direction from the creature as before either used dimension door.</li>  <li>Flame of Justice (divine, evocation) A legion archon’s spirit of righteousness manifests in its hands as a mighty two-handed sword called the flame of justice. A legion archon can throw its flame of justice as a ranged weapon. If disarmed or thrown, the flame of justice vanishes after landing or dealing damage and reappears in the legion archon’s hands again instantly. On a critical hit, the fire damage from the flame of justice deals maximum damage (6 on the d6) before being doubled for the critical hit, and the target takes 1d10 persistent fire damage.</li></ul></div>
