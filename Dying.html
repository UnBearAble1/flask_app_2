<div data-component-type="text"><div>You are bleeding out or otherwise at death’s door. While you have this condition, you are <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/kb/en/article/unconscious" target="_blank">unconscious</a>. Dying always includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you’re dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying value always begins at a number equal to the number of Serious or Grievous <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/injury-thresholds-and-healing" target="_blank">wounds</a> you have. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/unconscious" target="_blank">unconscious</a>, but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. </div><div><br /></div></div><div data-component-type="informative"><div class="info-container" info-color="red"><div class="info-title">Death and Dying Rules</div><div class="info-content"><div>The <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/kb/en/article/doomed" target="_blank">doomed</a>, dying, and <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/unconscious" target="_blank">unconscious</a> conditions as well as Wounds all relate to the process of coming closer to death. The full rules are <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/death-dying-and-recovery" target="_blank">found here</a>. The most significant information not contained in the conditions themselves is this: When you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points, you’re knocked out with the following effects:</div><div><br /></div><ul>
  <li>You immediately gain a wound, typically rolled randomly from the <a data-composite="true" href="https://pf2lazcut.wixanswers.com/en/article/hit-locations" target="_blank">Hit Locations table</a>. </li>  <li>You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.</li>  <li>You immediately gain the dying condition, at a value equal to the number of wounds you have. </li>  <li> If the damage came from a nonlethal attack or effect, you don’t gain the dying condition— you are instead unconscious with 0 Hit Points.</li></ul></div></div></div>
